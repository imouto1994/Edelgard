The devastation they wrought in Shambhala was immortalized in a tapestry, entitled \"Avatars of War,\" which preserved their legacy for generations. Afterward, the two were married. Constance was among the first to receive peerage from Emperor Edelgard, and though Balthus sometimes chafed from being at the mercy of his wife's whims, the couple worked diligently to solidify the new social order under Imperial rule. House Nuvelle was given no guarantee of continued power on a hereditary basis but nevertheless achieved lasting status as a leader in the magical arts.",
  "For her service in war, and her innovations in magic, Constance von Nuvelle was among the first to receive peerage in the new Fodlan. The very next day, she and Balthus were wed, and the couple set about the restoration of House Nuvelle. For their domain, they claimed not the land once ruled by that house, but rather an area in the east of Leicester that encompassed Kupala. There, they became known as advocates for the mountain folk, and as nobles who lived moment to moment as outlandishly as they pleased."

  "Shortly after the war, Hapi and Balthus disappeared. Their absence from the world stage was not lasting, however, as before long they emerged as the leaders of an elite band of mercenaries. The group traveled all over Fodlan helping those in need, with a noted specialty in handling monsters. It is said that these mercenaries lived raucously, laughing often, and that not a single sigh of discontent was ever heard. Some time later, when those who slither in the dark threatened Fodlan, it is rumored that these mercenaries were instrumental in dealing with them.",

They helped in the rebuilding effort here and there with magic and even the occasional sigh. When their wanderings were done, they returned to Garreg Mach, to which they also lent their restorative talents, both above and below the ground. It is said that they remained lifelong friends, steadfast through thick and thin forever after."
