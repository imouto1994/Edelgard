In Remire Village, three youths pursued by bandits solicit\naid from Jeralt and his mercenaries. Together, you help\nthem fight off their pursuers and defend the village.
Formerly a promising young mercenary, you are now the\nnewest professor at the prestigious Officers Academy.\nStudents and faculty alike look on with curiosity as you\nengage in a mock battle between the school's three houses.
Your students have received their first assignment:\nthey are to accompany the Knights of Seiros to the\nRed Canyon in order to help strike down a group\nof bandits. This will be their first real battle.
Your house must help the Knights of Seiros suppress\nLord Lonato's rebellion at Castle Gaspard. Though you\nare told not to expect combat, the deep fog at Magdred\nWay sets you ill at ease...
While the plot to assassinate the archbishop shakes the\nmonastery to its core, you suspect the enemy may have\na different motivation. Anxiety abounds as the Goddess's\nRite of Rebirth commences.
A group of thieves led by a disowned son of House Gautier\nhas stolen a Hero's Relic and begun to run amok. Seeking\nto neutralize this threat, the church is sending your house\nthere to settle the matter.
The monastery is shocked to learn that Seteth's younger\nsister, Flayn, has gone missing. After an exhaustive search\nfor clues, you finally come upon a lead...
The Battle of the Eagle and Lion, a traditional contest of\nstrength between the three houses, has arrived. It will take\nplace at Gronder Field, which lies in Imperial territory.
A pattern of strange occurrences in Remire Village has\nsuddenly erupted into something far more serious.
Things take a turn for the worse as you and Jeralt\ninvestigate an abandoned chapel in Garreg Mach.
In the pursuit of justice for Jeralt, you and your students\nfind yourselves deep in the Sealed Forest.
Your house ventures into the Holy Tomb to receive a\nrevelation from the goddess. In that hidden place,\ndeep beneath Garreg Mach, a shocking truth is revealed.
The Imperial army, led by Edelgard, advances on Garreg\nMach. As everyone struggles to process this turn of events,\nthe grim reality of war fast approaches.
Five years after the Battle of Garreg Mach, the ruins of the\ntown and monastery have been taken over by thieves.\nUnable to leave things as they are, you and an old friend\nteam up to get rid of them.
Fulfilling a promise made five years ago, your former\nstudents gather once more at the monastery, as do the\nknights. However, your joyful reunion is cut short...
Your party travels to Ailell, the Valley of Torment, to\nmeet up with allied troops and secure reinforcements.\nIt should have been a safe march...
After fending off the Empire, your forces decide it's time to\nadvance. But first, you must capture the Great Bridge of\nMyrddin, a strategic crossing point over the Airmid River,\nwhich borders the Alliance and the Empire.
At Gronder Field, where the Battle of the Eagle and Lion\nwas once held, the house leaders of five years ago have\na fateful reunion...but this time, the contest between the\nEmpire, the Kingdom, and the Alliance is no mock battle.

Fort Merceus, said to be impregnable, lies between you\nand Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. Seizing the sturdy\nfortress will require a carefully devised strategy.
Fort Merceus, said to be impregnable, lies between you\nand Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. Seizing the sturdy\nfortress will require a carefully devised strategy.
After Rodrigue's death, Dimitri reassesses his plan of\nattack. For the sake of the Kingdom, he chooses to\nforestall an invasion of the Empire in favor of securing\nhis own capital city of Fhirdiad.
Vastly outnumbered by Imperial forces, it becomes clear\nthat a surprise attack, followed by a short and decisive\nbattle, is the only path to victory. With this in mind,\nyou stealthily approach Enbarr, the Imperial Capital.
Shortly after reclaiming the Kingdom capital, a request for\naid arrives from Claude. To save the Alliance from ruin,\nyou head to Derdriu, the Aquatic Capital.
After tearing through Enbarr, it's finally time to storm\nthe Imperial palace. Your intention is to confront\nEdelgard, bring an end to the war, and locate Rhea,\nwhose whereabouts remain unknown.
After saving the embattled Alliance, you march south to\nEmpire territory. Fort Merceus, said to be impregnable,\nstands between you and Enbarr, the Imperial Capital.
Though the flame of war is quenched, its embers endure.\nYou travel deep underground to confront those who\nslither in the dark and bring lasting peace to FÃ³dlan.
With Fort Merceus conquered, it's time to approach\nEnbarr, the Imperial Capital. Imperial forces stand ready\nin the city streets, intending to resist to the bitter end.
With Shambhala in ruins, the five-year war is finally at an\nend and a new age of peace has arrived. Not long for this\nworld, Rhea wishes to discuss FÃ³dlan's future with EK00youEL00youEM00.\nBut all is not well...
Shambhala has fallen, but a mysterious army has emerged\nfrom its ruins, bearing the Crest of Flames on its banner.\nLeading this force is Nemesis, the King of Liberation,\npresumed dead for a thousand years.
After tearing through Enbarr, you proceed to storm the\nImperial palace. The time has finally come for Dimitri\nto confront Edelgard.
Emperor Edelgard has declared war on the Church of\nSeiros and the Crest-dominated world it has created.\nHer first move is to topple the most prominent symbol\nof the church's dominance: Garreg Mach.
The Black Eagle Strike Force has an unexpected encounter\nwith someone thought to have died years prior. Amidst the\njoy, your forces prepare to invade Alliance territory.
After seizing the Great Bridge of Myrddin, the Black Eagle\nStrike Force makes its way to Derdriu, the Aquatic\nCapital, where Claude awaits.
Absorbing the Alliance brings the Empire one step closer\nto a unified FÃ³dlan. The Black Eagle Strike Force returns\nto Garreg Mach to plan its invasion of the Kingdom,\nunaware of the enemy lurking in the shadows.
With razor-sharp focus on the unification of FÃ³dlan,\nEdelgard feigns a premature assault on Fhirdiad while\nthe Black Eagle Strike Force instead descends on the\nsouthern stronghold of Arianrhod.
The Black Eagle Strike Force, in its continued pursuit of\nFÃ³dlan's unification, marches on Fhirdiad. Kingdom and\nchurch forces prepare to meet you at Tailtean Plains,\na place laden with history.
With Dimitri fallen on the Tailtean Plains, Rhea pulls her\ntroops back to defend Fhirdiad, continuing a war that has\nspanned five long years.
Five years after Rhea's disappearance, a letter that she\nwrote prior to that battle has surfaced. The mysterious\nmessage raises more questions than it answers...
Arianrhod, the Fortress City, lies on what was once the\nborder between the Kingdom and the Empire and is a\nvaluable strategic asset. Dimitri intends to reclaim it.
As Edelgard works to reorganize the army after merging\nwith Alliance troops, she receives an urgent message from\nDuke Goneril, whose forces guard FÃ³dlan's Locket.
Interested in learning more about the legend of Macuil,\none of the Four Saints, Claude ventures out across the\nterritory of Margrave Edmund to the Sreng Region.
Sothis has a request for you, S0...\nAt her insistence, you travel alone to the Red Canyon,\nfollowed by curious students.
Dedue receives a concerning missive about his people,\nwho continue to bear the burden of oppression based on\nblame for the Tragedy of Duscur.
Safety for the people of the Kingdom has been a growing\nconcern, and Fraldarius territory is no exception. Felix has\nbeen called upon to help restore order back home.
When Catherine and the Knights of Seiros ride out to seek\nretribution against the Western Church for their attack on\nthe archbishop, Ashe is eager to accompany them.
Sylvain is unable to stand idly by when he learns that the\nband of thieves once led by his brother, Miklan, are again\ncausing trouble in Margrave Gautier's territory.
Whispers of Death Knight sightings in Garreg Mach\nexcite Caspar, but Mercedes has a much more pensive\nreaction. Something must be on her mind...
Annette and Gilbert hope to acquire the Hero's Relic of\nHouse Dominic from Annette's uncle, Baron Dominic.
Ingrid receives an unexpected proposal of marriage from a\nnoble of rising status. As soon as Dorothea hears the name,\nshe is adamantly against any engagement between them...
Hubert reveals some of his thoughts about the mysterious\npower aiding the Empire with strange technology. As fate\nwould have it, a visitor chooses that moment to arrive...
Amid riots in Hrym territory, Ferdinand learns that his\nmissing father, Duke Aegir, has been found. Lysithea,\nwho knows the area well, goes with him to investigate.
Without a Crest or a family fortune, Leonie has a difficult\ntime getting her hands on quality gear. Linhardt offers her\na hint about a sacred weapon anyone can wield.
The war in FÃ³dlan has put Brigid in a precarious position.\nWith Bernadetta in tow, Petra returns to her homeland in\nhopes of avoiding a confrontation with her grandfather.

S0 fought alongside Edelgard to bring\nan end to the tyranny of a godlike being. Though EK00heEL00sheEM00\nwas wounded in the battle and lost the power of the\nprogenitor god, EK00heEL00sheEM00 remained determined to walk EK00hisEL00herEM00\ndestined path. With EK00hisEL00herEM00 legendary blade in hand,\nEK00heEL00sheEM00 will never stop standing against those who slither\nin the dark until FÃ³dlan at last knows everlasting peace.

In the\naftermath of the loss of FÃ³dlan's great leading figures,\nEK00heEL00sheEM00 ascended the throne as the first leader of the\nUnited Kingdom of FÃ³dlan. In EK00hisEL00herEM00 heart lived the\nindelible hope that their efforts would one day yield\nan era in which the people knew true peace and the\nhorrors of war were a hazy memory of the past.
S0 helped Dimitri to finally crush the\nambitions of the Empire. After the war, Rhea stepped\ndown from her role as archbishop, and S0\nswore to lead the Church of Seiros in her stead.\nEK00HeEL00SheEM00 helped to guide the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus\nas it brought leadership to the newly unified FÃ³dlan\nand worked tirelessly to create a peaceful world\nfree from the shackles of oppression.
Together, S0 and Claude sent the Fell King\nNemesis, a foe from a bygone age, back to the flames of\neternity from whence he came. Afterward, Claude left\nFÃ³dlan, leaving S0 to ascend the throne\nas the first leader of the United Kingdom of FÃ³dlan.\nAs he took his schemes and dreams and efforts to a\nfar-off land, he hoped dearly that their joint efforts\nwould one day allow for a world where all of humanity\ncan coexist in peace and harmony, regardless of\nborders or bloodlines.
As the new Adrestian emperor, Edelgard dedicated her life\nto reshaping the delicate political structure of FÃ³dlan.\nWith tireless work and great sacrifice, she reformed\nthe class system to ensure a free and independent society\nfor all. In her later years, she entrusted her life's work\nto a worthy successor before finally vanishing from the\npublic eye.
After his coronation, Dimitri spent his life reforming and\nruling justly over FÃ³dlan. He focused particularly on\nimproving living situations for orphans and improving\nforeign relations.

He lived for his people and alongside them,\nand was thusly dubbed the Savior King.
Claude returned to his homeland of Almyra and assumed\nthe role of a politically active prince. After inheriting the\nthrone, he worked to improve relations with FÃ³dlan.\nIn addition to establishing new trade routes, he fostered\ntrust by sending reinforcements into FÃ³dlan to help quell\nrevolts by the remnants of the Imperial loyalists. Under his\nguidance, the peoples of FÃ³dlan and Almyra were finally\nable to set aside age-old prejudices, and over time,\nthe fallacies of old were all but forgotten.
Hubert devoted his life fully to the service of Edelgard.\nOperating in the light and the shadows alike, he disposed\nof countless burdens facing his emperor, using any means\nnecessary. Though his ghastly appearance and imposing\ndemeanor were ever feared, he paid his reputation little\nheed, focusing instead on his loyalty to the emperor.

In recognition of his achievements during the war, Caspar\nwas given the title of Minister of Military Affairs in the\nnew Adrestian Empire. Though his command developed a\nreputation for occasional recklessness, he proved an able\nleader, guiding his troops to overcome countless obstacles.\nLong after his career had ended, tall tales of the glory and\ngood cheer that he brought to his army endured.
After the war, Caspar set out alone on a journey of\nself-discovery. He traveled to every corner of FÃ³dlan and\neven ventured abroad now and again. It is said that he got\ninto mischief at every turn but that the victims of his\nantics, always more amused than harmed or offended,\nremembered him fondly and passed those stories on to\nfuture generations.
As soon as Bernadetta inherited House Varley from her\nfather, she withdrew from all political discourse and\nfocused solely on the management of her own territory.\nBecause of this and her penchant for spending long\nperiods of time in "hibernation," she became known\nthroughout the house's history as the "Bear of Varley."
Dorothea returned to the Mittelfrank Opera as soon as the\nwar was over. Thanks to her talent, the company enjoyed a\nresurgence in popularity that lasted well beyond the end\nof her own career.

Later in his life, he inherited his\nfather's nickname and was known throughout the\nKingdom as the Shield of Faerghus's worthy successor.
Even after the war's end, skirmishes continued to break\nout across FÃ³dlan. Bored and restless in his capacity as\nDuke Fraldarius, Felix abandoned his title, jumping at\nthe opportunity to wield a sword again. Little is known\nof his whereabouts thereafter, but even many years later,\nsoldiers continued to whisper rumors of a mysterious man\nable to deal swift death to scores of enemies.
After the war, Ashe was formally knighted and appointed\nthe new head of House Gaspard, which had no successors.\nHis warm, sincere attitude toward his subjects was praised\nall over FÃ³dlan, and Ashe was finally recognized as the\nideal knight he'd always hoped to be.

Annette returned to her hometown of Fhirdiad where she\ntook up a teaching position at the Royal School of Sorcery.\nShe was a gifted instructor, and many of her students went\non to become world-renowned sages.

Ingrid declined to rule House Galatea, choosing instead\nto serve House Blaiddyd as a knight. After achieving\nwidespread renown, she formed an elite order of pegasus\nknights who served as personal bodyguards to the nobility.\nShe never took a husband.
When Galatea territory was seized, Ingrid argued strongly\nfor the preservation of its borders. Her request was\ngranted, and she was appointed to rule.

Her efforts bore fruit, to\nthe people's delight, and Galatea became a land of plenty.

Lysithea returned home to help her parents restore their\nfamily land. Years later, when the end to their hard work\nwas finally in sight, she relinquished House Ordelia's claim\nto nobility, ceding the territory to a nearby lord. Shortly\nthereafter, she and her family disappeared into obscurity.
Marianne returned home to a hero's welcome. The people\npraised her talent and acknowledged her as a savior of\nFÃ³dlan. Her adoptive father groomed her as his successor,\nteaching her the power of words over weapons. By the\ntime she claimed her inheritance, she had transformed into\none of FÃ³dlan's most skilled orators.
After the war, Hilda set politics aside and focused on what\nshe enjoyed most: crafting fashionable accessories. Her\ndesigns quickly achieved widespread popularity.

Many\nlong years later, however, a young woman resurfaced in\na completely transformed FÃ³dlan. When she looked to\nthe man who stood beside her, she wondered if it would\nbe all right, in this new era, to call him Father.
Flayn disappeared soon after the war, and after a time,\nproof of her very existence faded from memory. Many\nyears later, a young woman appeared at the monastery,\nwhich had been restored to its former glory. Speaking to\nno one in particular, it is said that she gazed at the\nentrance and reverently whispered, "I am home."
Though FÃ³dlan had changed, Hanneman's goal remained\nunwavering: to determine the workings of the Crests and\nto do away with the inequality caused by them. To that\nend, his research resulted in magical tools that could be\nused even without the aid of Crests. This proved to be yet\nanother worthwhile discovery by the Father of Crestology.
Manuela left Garreg Mach to build her own academy in\na small, war-torn town. There, she contributed heavily to\nrebuilding efforts while teaching future generations the\nnecessary skills of survival. Though she never married or\nhad children of her own, she spent the last years of her life\nhappily devoted to her students.
Gilbert returned to Fhirdiad and resumed his duty as a\nknight, faithfully serving King Dimitri for many years.\nWhen he finally retired, it is said he spent the rest of his\ndays coaching the young prince in the art of combat.
Once the long war against those who slither in the dark\ncame to an end, Alois and his family moved to Remire\nVillage and lived happily as farmers. It is said that from\nthe moment he put down his sword and picked up a hoe,\nhe never so much as thought about turning back.
Once all the fighting had come to an end, Alois officially\ntook up the position of captain of the Knights of Seiros.\nIn this capacity, he was much beloved, and the Knights\nbecame more unified than ever under his command. It is\nsaid that their accomplishments during his tenure were\nbeyond even what Jeralt's troop had achieved.
When Rhea resigned her position of archbishop and left\nthe Church of Seiros, Catherine followed. She devoted\nherself wholly to Rhea's protection, and the two lived a life\nof quiet seclusion. Though Thunderbrand remained\nalways by her side, she came to be known by a different\nname: the Guardian of Zanado.
Catherine left the Knights of Seiros and set out to travel\nacross FÃ³dlan. With Thunderbrand in hand, she wandered\nthe countryside, seeking always to defend the innocent and\npunish the wicked. Her many years of heroics ensured that\nshe would always be remembered by the people as a\nbeloved folk hero.
Shortly after the war, Shamir gave up the mercenary life\nand disappeared. Though she was never heard from again,\nrumors swirled persistently for years of a master archer\nturned thief who lined her pockets by shaking down all\nthose who preyed upon the innocent.
Unable to serve Rhea any longer, Cyril nearly left the\nchurch. He was persuaded to stay, however, to assist\nin rebuilding the monastery he had helped maintain.\nThanks to his devoted work ethic, the Officers Academy\nwas able to reopen a few years later. When the new\nstudents took the reception hall, Cyril found himself\namong them.
S0 and Edelgard ended the tyranny of a\ngodlike being. S0 was wounded and lost\nthe power of the progenitor god, but it mattered not,\nas EK00heEL00sheEM00 and Edelgard had each other. To ensure lasting\npeace, the two fought against those who slither in the\ndark, and to ensure a society where people can rise and\nfall by their own merits, they spent their lives reforming\nthe antiquated class system. They achieved much in their\ntime together, and it is said that they were sometimes\nspotted leaving the palace to privately enjoy the world\nthey had created. How they spent those precious\nmoments, none but the two of them will ever know.
Paired with the end of the war, the joyous marriage of\nS0, the newly-appointed archbishop,\nand Dimitri, the newly-crowned king of Faerghus,\ngave the people of FÃ³dlan much to celebrate. The two\nwere devoted to improving life for the people and to\nseeking greater wisdom in order to reform the government\nand the church from the inside out. As leaders of church\nand state respectively, at times they engaged in heated\ndebate. Even still, when enjoying a long horse ride or a\nquiet evening, they were not as the world saw them,\nbut rather two adoring spouses, desperately in love.\nThey remained as such for the rest of their days.
After ascending the throne as the first leader of the United\nKingdom of FÃ³dlan, S0 sought to rebuild\nthe war-torn towns and villages and to help guide the\nreformation of the Church of Seiros.

History books extol Ferdinand's success as a lord\nof his territories, but make no mention of his marriage.\nThus, half of his life's work is lost to time.

He won\nher affection, and after receiving the blessing of her\ngrandfather, the king of Brigid, the two were wed.\nSome years later, each inherited their respective thrones.\nAs the monarchs of Brigid and Almyra, Petra and Claude\nfostered friendly diplomatic relations between the two\nregions and FÃ³dlan.
Claude disappeared from FÃ³dlan after the war, leaving the\nnew head of House Gloucester, Lorenz, to support the\nnew United Kingdom of FÃ³dlan in his stead. He proposed\nrevolutionary policies to restore the war-torn region at a\nrapid rate. When the rebuilding effort was complete,\nLorenz turned his eye toward diplomacy, seeking to\nestablish treaties of friendship with foreign nations.\nAlmyra was no exception, and when the two parties met\nfor a summit at FÃ³dlan's Locket, it was none other than\nClaude, the new king of Almyra, who arrived to negotiate.\nSome speculated that this meeting had been Claude's\nscheme all along, but Lorenz and Claude both denied it.
Entrusting the future of FÃ³dlan to his friends, Claude left\nfor Almyra to reclaim his place as heir to the throne.\nWhen he became king, he asked Lysithea to be his queen\nwith a heart full of love, and with the hope of fostering\nfriendly diplomatic relations with FÃ³dlan. Due to her\nshortened lifespan, Lysithea declined. Claude, unable to\nabandon his love for her, gave up the throne to go on a\nquest for a means to save her. Years later, he appeared\nsuddenly before her, claiming to have found a cure.\nWith her trust and love to guide him, he whisked her\naway, across the sea. It is unknown where they went.
Entrusting the future of FÃ³dlan to his friends, Claude left\nfor Almyra to reclaim his place as heir to the throne.\nSeveral years later, when he became king, he took initial\nsteps to open trade routes with FÃ³dlan, and entered into\nnegotiations with Margrave Edmund. During this time,\nhe was reunited with Marianne, who had grown under her\nadoptive father's guidance into a wise and talented woman.\nShe offered him her aid, and as they worked together to\nsecure friendly relations between their respective nations,\nthey fell deeply in love.
Entrusting the future of FÃ³dlan to his friends, Claude left\nfor Almyra to take his place as heir to the throne.\nHis family saw that he had grown strong and allowed\nhim to claim his birthright. When he became king several\nyears later, he made the surprise announcement that he\nwould make Hilda his queen. Having studied with her\nbrother to prepare for this moment, Hilda demonstrated\nan uncanny talent for diplomacy, and greatly contributed\nto establishing friendly relations between FÃ³dlan and\nAlmyra. The presence of a FÃ³dlan-born queen for two\nconsecutive generations did much to alter Almyran values.
Leonie returned to Sauin Village to repay her debts and\nmysteriously vanished afterwards. Some years later,\nwhen trade between FÃ³dlan and Almyra began in earnest,\nthe village received notice that the Almyran king would be\npassing through on his way to Garreg Mach. The village\nrushed to prepare themselves. When the anticipated day\narrived, they were shocked to find Leonie at the king's\nside. She had gone to visit Claude in Almyra, and had\nended up staying to become his queen. Faced with the\nsight of Leonie in the resplendent clothing of a monarch,\nher father and the other villagers could do nothing but\nstand in mute amazement.

During this time, he was reunited\nwith Flayn, who had been helping Seteth run the church.\nShe agreed to help, and as they worked together to secure\nfriendly relations between their respective regions,\nthey fell deeply in love. It is said that Seteth never learned\nof their relationship.
After the war, Claude returned home to Almyra and took\nhis place in the royal family. Some years later he became\nking, and during his reign, promoted policies to improve\nrelations with FÃ³dlan and protect children who had been\norphaned by the war. After he achieved his goals, he left\nthe throne to a family member and left Almyra. During his\ntravels, he encountered Shamir, who had been wandering\nthe world as a mercenary. It is known that they traveled\ntogether from that day forward, but where they journeyed\nto remains a mystery.
Hubert and Ferdinand became the left and right hands of\nEmperor Edelgard, competing constantly with each other\nto see who could be the more helpful. They were\noppositesâthe Minister of the Imperial Household,\nmelancholy and merciless, and the prime minister, bright\nand compassionate. Still, they brought out the best in each\nother. As the Empire became orderly and prosperous, the\ntwo came to be known as the nation's "Two Jewels," and\nwere remembered fondly for generations to come. Some\nsay their fame made even Emperor Edelgard jealous.
The marriage between Hubert, Minister of the Imperial\nHousehold, and Bernadetta, leader of House Varley,\nwas so surprising to the public that it was much talked\nabout even outside of political circles in the capital.\nBernadetta took the opportunity to survey the far reaches\nof the new Adrestian Empire, and in her absence,\nHubert took well to the management of Varley territory.\nThey proved to be an astonishingly good match,\nworking together to protect FÃ³dlan from the shadows.\nIt is said that they showed their affection for one another\nby wearing matching embroidered flowers.\n
After the war, the Mittelfrank Opera Company made a\nresurgence, in no small part thanks to the patronage of\nEmperor Edelgard's confidant, Hubert. Dorothea made a\ncomeback as a songstress within the troupe, which traveled\nall over FÃ³dlan, putting a large share of its profits toward\nrelief efforts. The opera company was warmly welcomed\nby the war-weary people as a source of solace, and became\neven more famous than before. It was not discovered until\nmany years later that the troupe's tour had been a covert\noperation, coordinated by Hubert and Dorothea to gather\nintelligence for the Empire.
Shortly after the war, Brigid renegotiated its diplomatic\narrangement with the Adrestian Empire, ending its service\nas a vassal and becoming a full ally. As part of that\nagreement, Petra, queen of Brigid, was wed to Hubert,\nMarquis Vestra. Some say that the marriage was purely\npolitical, ordered by Emperor Edelgard, while others insist\nthat it was of their own accord. Although they led busy\nlives, and sometimes lived separately. Still, their shared\nhome in the western FÃ³dlan village of Nuvelle was filled\nwith their many children, suggesting a loving union.
As confidant to Edelgard, Hubert disposed of every burden\nfacing his emperor by any means necessary, and excelled\nat working in the shadows. Supporting him from the front\nlines was the former mercenary, Shamir, who commanded\nthe emperor's elite troops. When the two married, they\nappeared from the outside to be little more than a lord of\nthe Empire and his dutiful wife. In reality, their nights\nwere filled with fierce combat against rebels, assassins, and\nthose who slither in the dark. It is reported that one of\nthem was known to often state that, "To find love between\nlife and death is a gift." It is unknown which of the two\nactually spoke these words.
After the war, Mercedes traveled to Fhirdiad to pay a visit\nto her adoptive father. Though she introduced Ferdinand,\nshe left out the small detail that they were engaged to be\nwed. Married in secret, Ferdinand and Mercedes worked\ntogether to reform the new Duke Aegir's territory, and\nthe effort was so successful that Emperor Edelgard named\nFerdinand her prime minister. It was a busy life for him\nindeed, but as he was known to say to his government\ncolleagues, coming home to a smiling family made all the\nhard work worth it.

After the war, Bernadetta renounced her claim to House\nVarley. She married Ferdinand, the new Duke Aegir, and\nthe two contributed to relief efforts by instituting reforms\nacross their Dukedom. Due to the success of those\npolicies, Ferdinand was offered the position of prime\nminister by the emperor. He accepted, leaving the\nmanagement of Aegir territory to his wife, while he\nworked to apply their ideas to the Empire at large. Since\nBernadetta did not like to leave home, Ferdinand's life\ninvolved a lot of travel to and from the capital, but it is\nsaid he always embarked on his return home with a smile\non his face.

After officially becoming the new Duke Aegir, Ferdinand\nset about reforming his territory. Thanks to the wisdom of\nhis wife, Dorothea, Ferdinand's policies were of massive\nbenefit to the commonfolk and brought about a swift\nrecovery. In recognition of this achievement, he was called\nupon by Emperor Edelgard to introduce these reforms to\nthe Empire at large as the new prime minister. Though the\nwork kept him very busy, he always managed to find time\nfor Dorothea. It is said that their children filled their\nloving household with beautiful music ever after.

Though the work\nof reforming the entire nation kept him very busy, he\nalways managed to find time for Dorothea. It is said that\ntheir children filled their loving household with beautiful\nmusic ever after.
After officially becoming Duke Aegir, Ferdinand asked\nEmperor Edelgard if she would make him her minister of\nforeign affairs rather than her prime minister. She granted\nhis wish, and his first task in his new position was to\nnegotiate with Petra, who had inherited the throne of\nBrigid and declared her Kingdom's freedom from Imperial\nvassalage. Ferdinand and Petra collaborated to deepen the\nfriendship between their nations and forge a strong,\nenduring alliance. As a symbol of the nations' friendship,\nFerdinand and Petra took up residence together in\nNuvelle, on the western fringe of FÃ³dlan. It is said that\nthey negotiated for years to achieve this compromise.
After officially becoming Duke Aegir, Ferdinand worked\nto restore the territory, and as part of that effort, sought to\ndevelop an improved relationship with Brigid. He reached\nout to Petra, who had inherited the throne of Brigid, and\nshe agreed to send resources for the relief effort. At the\nsame time, the two continued their private relationship\nacross borders, and when Aegir territory had recovered,\nthey married. Ferdinand relocated to Brigid with his\nqueen, and the pair worked tirelessly to improve\ndiplomatic relations. Their work involved much travel,\nbut they made sure to find time once in a while to stop\nand enjoy their happiness.
Ferdinand announced his engagement to Marianne just\nafter becoming the new Duke Aegir. While he got started\nrestoring his territory, Marianne returned home to study\npolitics under her shrewd adoptive father. When she\nreturned to Ferdinand's side, they were wed, and with\nher new skills she proved herself to be an asset to the\nrebuilding effort. Aegir territory flourished under their\nreign, becoming one of the most prosperous regions in all\nFÃ³dlan. It is said that Ferdinand commissioned a bronze\nstatue of his wife to honor her, but that Marianne ordered\nit to be hidden away in storage for eternity.
Ferdinand announced his marriage to Marianne just\nafter becoming the new Duke Aegir. With the support of\nMargrave Edmund, they set to work restoring Aegir\nterritory. The support of Marianne's adoptive father was\nessential, but not sufficient, for the relief effort. As more\ndifficulties arose, Marianne herself took on an increasing\namount of responsibility. She proved quite capable and\ndedicated, and the Dukedom progressed through a steady\nrecovery under the couple's collective efforts. It is said that\nFerdinand commissioned a bronze statue of his wife to\nhonor her achievements, but Marianne ordered it to be\nhidden away in storage for eternity.
After becoming the new Duke Aegir, Ferdinand married\nHilda, the daughter of Duke Goneril. The marriage was\nwarmly received by the people, with high expectations\nplaced on them as they set about restoring the territory.\nHilda rarely took part in politics herself, but she still\ncontributed greatly by recommending exceptional people\nto influential positions. Her hobby of creating fashionable\naccessories also bore fruit, as her designs achieved\nwidespread popularity, and she created the first artisan\nacademy in FÃ³dlan. The school produced many talented\ncraftsmen, including Ferdinand himself, who was said to\ncraft handmade trinkets for his wife.
Ferdinand married Flayn just after becoming the new\nDuke Aegir, and the pair wasted no time getting to work\non the rebuilding effort. While Ferdinand handled\nadministrative matters, Flayn walked more directly among\nthe people, seeing to their needs. Their teamwork and\ncomplementary skills led to rapid recovery and growth for\nthe region, but it is said that what inspired the people most\nof all was the genuine intimacy and affection between the\nruling couple.
Almost immediately after becoming the new Duke Aegir,\nFerdinand married Manuela, and the two dedicated\nthemselves to reformation efforts. Manuela lent her\nconsiderable talent and experience, using personal\nconnections she'd gained in her time as a songstress and\nteacher to assemble a team of talented people. Between her\npersonal skills and her ability as a physician, she became\nso essential that the emperor saw fit to make her the new\nprime minister. As she spent more time in the capital,\nbringing the reforms that helped Aegir territory to the\nEmpire at large, Ferdinand stayed behind, minding his\nown lands and looking after their child.

When the Officers Academy reopened after the war,\nLinhardt gave up his inheritance to take on a position as a\nprofessor there. He soon married Annette, who had taken\non the same job, and side by side, they helped to educate\nthe next generation of students. Unfortunately, Annette\ntook her teaching duties far more seriously than Linhardt,\nwho was more concerned with his Crest research, and\ndeveloped a reputation for falling asleepâsometimes more\nthan onceâduring his own lectures. In their first few years\nas a couple she fought desperately to correct his behavior,\nbut later she learned to accept it, and even looked forward\nto finding creative ways to wake him up.
After the war, Linhardt and Caspar abandoned their\nnoble houses to pursue a carefree journey wandering the\nworld. They traveled to every corner of FÃ³dlan, and even\nventured abroad now and again. Caspar got into trouble at\nevery turn on their travels, but Linhardt was always there,\nbegrudgingly, to get him out of it. The records of their\nadventures were immortalized in a book by an anonymous\nauthor, entitled "The Thousand Roads and Seven Seas."\nIt is said they did eventually settle down, after the events\nin those stories, but where they actually went is unknown.
Linhardt and Bernadetta caused quite the stir after the\nwar when they abandoned their inherited titles and\neloped to Garreg Mach. Returning to the monastery,\nwhere they were always most comfortable, the couple lived\npeaceful lives away from the hassle of politics. When the\nEmpire's efforts to restore the church were complete, the\nOfficers Academy reopened, and two eccentric individuals\ntook up professorships there. One was perpetually asleep,\nor absorbed in absentminded study; the other refused to\nshow herself at all unless it was time to give a lecture.

Returning to the monastery,\nwhere they were always most comfortable, the couple lived\npeaceful lives away from the hassle of politics. When the\nchurch was fully restored, the Officers Academy reopened,\nand two eccentric individuals took up professorships there.\nOne was perpetually asleep, or absorbed in absentminded\nstudy; the other refused to show herself at all unless it was\ntime to give a lecture.
After the war, Linhardt decided to inherit his title. He\nspent several years studying his territory, learning to\nmanage its affairs, and when he was finally ready to\nbecome the new Count Hevring, he announced his\nmarriage to Dorothea. Somehow, despite all this activity,\nLinhardt actually managed to keep up with his Crest\nstudies. Though his results were dubious at times, his new\nwife helped him alter them so that they would be of use to\npeople. Their relationship was unlike anything the\nnobility had ever witnessed. When faced with this\naccusation, Linhardt and Dorothea could only laugh and\nnote that the past was of no significance to them.
Petra returned to her homeland of Brigid, and inherited\nthe throne from her grandfather. As ruler, she declared\nindependence from FÃ³dlan, and renegotiated Brigid's\ndiplomatic relationships on more equal terms. Next, she\nintroduced industrial practices that were modeled on those\nof FÃ³dlan, vastly improving her homeland's economy. This\nrapid development surprised those abroad, until it was\ndiscovered that the improvements came thanks to the\ncounsel of Petra's husband, Linhardt, who had left FÃ³dlan\nto offer Brigid his talent and insight. It is said that the\ncouple maintained a healthy and affectionate relationship,\nand that they raised many happy children together.
Though Linhardt researched vigorously for a method by\nwhich to remove the Crests from Lysithea and save her\nlife, the war ended before he could reach any conclusions.\nLysithea, deciding that she should return home to her\nparents, thanked Linhardt and took her leave of Garreg\nMach. Not to be deterred, Linhardt set his affairs in order,\nrenounced his noble title, and followed Lysithea to\nOrdelia territory to continue his research. Years later, his\nefforts bore fruit, and Lysithea's Crests were successfully\nremoved. With a new future ahead of her, Lysithea, too,\nrenounced her noble claim, and the couple married as\ncommoners. It is said they raised a very happy family.
Marianne returned home to a warm welcome from her\nadoptive father, who recognized her wisdom and skill and\nbegan to groom her as his successor. Meanwhile, Linhardt\nabandoned his noble claim, and happened to choose\nMargrave Edmund's territory as the site at which to\ncontinue his Crest research. Edmund took a liking to\nLinhardt and approved wholeheartedly when the scholar\nand his daughter expressed their wish to marry. As\nEdmund's successors, the couple combined Linhardt's\nbrilliance with Marianne's practical wisdom to bring\nabundance to the people.
Immediately after the war, Flayn disappeared from Garreg\nMach. At the same time, Linhardt mysteriously abandoned\nhis claim to House Hevring, and also vanished. It was\nsuspected, among those who knew them, that they had\neloped, although no one seemed to know just where they\nwent. Over a decade later, well after the Officers Academy\nhad been rebuilt, something strange happened. A sleepy\nyoung girl with antiquated clothing and the Major Crest\nof Cethleann enrolled. Over the next two years, a young\nboy and girl with that same Crest also enrolled. Though\nCrest scholars deduced that they must be siblings,\nthe truth of their lineage was never definitely proven.
When Rhea absconded her post as archbishop, Catherine\nresigned from the Knights of Seiros and accompanied her\nto a life of seclusion in the Red Canyon. They were joined\nby Catherine's new husband, Linhardt, who continued his\nCrest research at Catherine's behest. Motivated by his\nwife, and freed from all other distractions, Linhardt made\nnew discoveries at an astonishing rate. The fruits of his\nresearch brought about dramatic changes in the world of\nCrest research, but for the sake of his privacy, Linhardt\nalways published his papers anonymously.
Catherine left the Knights of Seiros and set out to travel\nacross FÃ³dlan. With Thunderbrand in hand, she wandered\nthe countryside, seeking always to defend the innocent and\npunish the wicked. During these years of heroics, she had\nan unusual traveling companion in Linhardt, who had\nrenounced his noble title and followed her. During their\nadventures, Catherine was said to be nearly unstoppable,\nand Linhardt all but uselessâexcept in moments of great\nneed, when the Crest scholar's wisdom would suddenly\ncarry the day. The pair's adventures lived on as beloved\nfolktales, passed down through the generations. It is\nunclear whether the two were ever romantically involved.
After the war, Caspar and Ashe embarked on a carefree\njourney around the world. They traveled to every corner\nof FÃ³dlan, and even ventured abroad now and again, with\nthe sole purpose of punishing those who preyed upon the\nhelpless. Though Caspar seemed to get into trouble at\nevery turn, Ashe was always there to get him out of it, and\nCaspar's bravery and strength returned the favor more\nthan once. Though opposites in many ways, they shared\nthe same view of justice, and their abilities complemented\none another nicely. The stories of their adventures lived on\nas exciting and amusing folktales.
In recognition of his achievements during the war, Caspar\nwas given the title of Minister of Military Affairs in the\nnew Adrestian Empire. Though he was well-known for his\nvalor in battle, it was his wife, Annette, who reined in his\nrecklessness and who truly kept the army in order. The\ntroops came to see Annette as a motherly figure, and under\nher guidance, the Imperial army thrived. In their private\nlife as a couple, the roles were totally reversed, as Caspar\nhad to be the one to step in and correct Annette's various\ncalamities around the house.
Annette returned to her hometown of Fhirdiad, where she\ntook up a teaching position at the school of sorcery and\nmentored many great sages. Unfortunately, she remained\nprone to accidents, and one such event nearly took her life.\nSeparated from her students in the mountains, she became\ntotally lostâbut just when it seemed she would never be\nfound, she was rescued by none other than Caspar, who\nhappened to be passing through on his travels around the\nworld. After this lucky reunion, he escorted her to\nFhirdiad, and during his time there, the two fell in love.\nThe couple's fateful tale inspired a generation of young,\nstarry-eyed students.
After some uncertainty about the details, it was decided\nthat Caspar would marry into Bernadetta's family, seeing\nas she had claim to House Varley. The two had a chaotic\nreign, and a marriage to match. Each time Caspar caused\nsome incident, Bernadetta would demand promises as\nrecompense. Over time, these oaths accumulated to such a\ngreat number that it became necessary to compile them,\nand the resulting document came to be known as the "47\nArticles of Bernie." Among these Articles was the provision\nthat, when counting their large quantity of children,\nCaspar was not to accidentally count his wife among them.
In recognition of his achievements during the war, Caspar\nwas given the title of Minister of Military Affairs in the\nnew Adrestian Empire. Though his command developed a\nreputation for occasional recklessness, he proved an able\nleader, guiding his troops to overcome countless obstacles.\nIn his personal life, he began to spend a great deal of time\nwith Dorothea, who had returned to the Mittelfrank\nOpera Company after the war. When her efforts brought\nthe opera house to the peak of its resurgence, it is said that\nDorothea relinquished her position as songstress in order\nto retire with Caspar. They are rumored to have spent the\nrest of their lives together.
After the war, Caspar set out alone on a journey of\nself-discovery. He traveled to every corner of FÃ³dlan, and\neven ventured abroad now and again. Though his antics\nfound him no end of exciting adventures, he was always\ndrawn back to Dorothea, who had returned to the\nMittelfrank Opera Company in Enbarr after the war. The\ntwo spent more and more time together over the years,\nand when Dorothea's efforts brought the opera house to\nthe peak of its resurgence, she relinquished her position as\nsongstress and disappeared from the stage. It is rumored\nthat the pair spent the rest of their lives together.
Petra returned to her homeland of Brigid, and inherited\nthe throne from her grandfather. As ruler, she declared\nindependence from FÃ³dlan, and renegotiated Brigid's\ndiplomatic ties to FÃ³dlan and Dagda on more equal terms.\nAt every step along the way, she was accompanied and\nsupported by her husband, Caspar, who had left FÃ³dlan\nbehind to be with her. It is said that the people of Brigid\nwere initially suspicious of the union, due to Caspar's\nrelation to a nemesis of their homeland, but that his\ntireless efforts on Brigid's behalf endeared them to him\nover time. It certainly helped that he made the queen\nvery happy.
Caspar and Hilda, under no pressure to inherit any noble\ntitles, spent the early years of peace after the war traveling.\nThey journeyed to every corner of FÃ³dlan, and even\nventured abroad now and again. Caspar's antics caused\nendless entertainment for Hilda, who loved to stand by\nand watch him fight or squirm his way out of trouble.\nEventually, their free-spirited adventure was called to an\nend by Hilda's brother, Holst, who offered Caspar a\nposition as a knight in service of House Goneril. Caspar\naccepted, and before long, he and Hilda were married.\nThe couple raised many children, and were said to have a\nnotoriously lively household.
When Rhea absconded her post as archbishop, Catherine\nresigned from the Knights of Seiros and followed in order\nto protect her. They were joined by Catherine's new\nhusband, Caspar, who had the same goal, and together\nthey retired to a life of seclusion in the Red Canyon.\nCaspar and Catherine spent the bulk of their days farming\nand hunting, but since neither was content to go a day\nwithout wielding a weapon, they sparred routinely.\nThe sound of their swords ringing out, in time with\nCaspar's heated cries, was heard daily across the valley.
Catherine resigned from the Knights of Seiros and traveled\nacross FÃ³dlan with Caspar. They dedicated themselves to\ndefending the helpless wherever they went, and in time,\nthe names Thunder Catherine and Inferno Caspar were\nknown to all the world. Legends of their adventures\nbecame so popular and well-known that even catchphrases\nsuch as "Face the wrath of Thunderbrand!" and "Hey,\nthat's not your sword!" were recounted in the stories that\nwere passed down for generations.
After the war, Caspar and Shamir used their clout as\nheroes to establish a mercenary company. They branded\nthemselves as crusaders for justice, punishing those who\npreyed on the weak or exploited others for their own gain.\nNone could compete against their combined martial skill,\nand they became famous all throughout FÃ³dlan. Their\ntravels took them to every part of the world, and while\nCaspar's antics occasionally got him into trouble, Shamir's\nsteady presence and firm demeanor helped to resolve\nmatters amicably. Their stories endured as amusing\nanecdotes, passed down through generations.
After the war, Felix inherited the title of Duke Fraldarius\nfrom his late father, Rodrigue. He married Bernadetta,\nwho abandoned claim to House Varley in order to start a\nlife with him. After they had finished restoring Fraldarius\nterritory, Felix traveled across FÃ³dlan as the king's right\nhand. While he was away, Bernadetta handled local affairs\nwhile holed up in her room in the castle. The frigid air of\nnorthern Faerghus caused her to hide away even more\nthan usual, but whenever her beloved husband returned,\nshe would rush out to greet him.
After the war, Felix attempted to set out on his own, but\nwas waylaid by Bernadetta, who begged him not to go.\nPersuaded to stay, Felix ended up marrying into House\nVarley, the title of which Bernadetta had inherited. The\ncouple got along smoothly, although it was rumored that\nin the early years of their marriage, she once had to\nrestrain him physically to prevent him taking a trip to the\nOghma Mountains to train. As the years wore on,\nBernadetta became more reclusive, and Felix took over\nmany of the day-to-day duties of running the house.\nDocuments from their later years were increasingly signed\nwith the name Felix, Count Varley.
When Bernadetta first inherited control of House Varley,\nshe hid away and would not dare involve herself in\npolitical or administrative affairs. During this time it\nwas Raphael who came to her aid, encouraging her to\nwork through her fear of people. The training period was\ndifficultâ"humiliating," according to the journals\nBernadetta left behindâbut in the end, it had its desired\neffect. The leader of House Varley became an outgoing\nand authoritative individual, taking part in public policy.\nShe even took on a very muscular husband.
After the war, Seteth remained at the monastery and\ndedicated himself to the restoration of the church. He was\nsoon joined by Bernadetta, who abandoned her inheritance\nto House Varley and took up residence at Garreg Mach to\ncommit to a life as a recluse. As the years wore on, Seteth\nwrote many fables, first in his spare time, and then later as\nhis main preoccupation. His stories became famous among\nchildren throughout FÃ³dlan. As he gained renown, many\nbegan to inquire about the wonderful illustrations that\naccompanied the writing. In response to these questions,\nSeteth was known to shrug and say, "Ask my wife...if you\ncan find her."
After the war, Felix inherited the title of Duke Fraldarius\nfrom his late father, Rodrigue. He married Dorothea,\nand the two began a happy life together. After they had\nfinished restoring Fraldarius territory, Felix traveled across\nFÃ³dlan as the king's right hand. Dorothea traveled with\nhim always, and even threw herself into battle alongside\nhim every so often. Tales of their bravery endured for\ngenerations, thanks in no small part to the operas that\nDorothea wrote and composed herself.
Even after the war's end, skirmishes continued to break\nout across FÃ³dlan. Learning that there were still places\nwhere he could fight, Felix abandoned his noble title and\nchose to make a living with his sword. He traveled the\nland, and some years later found himself in Enbarr. There\nhe encountered Dorothea, who had just resumed her\ncareer as a songstress in the opera. From that time on,\nno matter how far Felix traveled, he always found himself\ndrawn back to that opera house. It is said that, when\nDorothea saw his face in the crowd, she sang only for him.
After more than 10 proposals, Dorothea finally relented\nand agreed to marry Sylvain. Together they inherited\nGautier territory. With the support of his wife's counsel,\nthe new Margrave Gautier was able to improve relations\nwith the Sreng people, and thereby convince the local\nnobles that Relics and Crests were no longer an absolute\nrequirement for survival. Due to their efforts, they went\ndown in history as an extraordinary lord and lady.\nIt is said that what finally convinced Dorothea to marry\nSylvain was his promise that they would grow old happily\ntogether, and that he was true to his word.
Petra returned to her homeland of Brigid, and inherited\nthe throne from her grandfather. As ruler, she declared\nindependence from FÃ³dlan, and renegotiated Brigid's\ndiplomatic ties to that nation on more equal terms. At\nevery step along the way, she was accompanied by\nDorothea, who had left FÃ³dlan behind to support her.\nDorothea used the connections she had made in her time\nat the opera to her benefit, and even worked reluctantly\nwith the FÃ³dlan nobility for Petra's sake. The people of\nBrigid were skeptical of her at first, but warmed up to\nher over time. It is said that she became the person whom\nPetra loved the most.
As the new head of House Gloucester, Lorenz first worked\nto restore his own territory, and then expanded his vision\nto include reforms for all FÃ³dlan. At the height of his\nstoried political career, he announced his marriage to\nDorothea, who had returned to prominence with the\nMittelfrank Opera Company. The elaborate wedding was\nthe most talked-about social event of the season, and the\nfashions on display from the savvy nobleman and the\nstylish songstress set the trends with young people across\nFÃ³dlan for a decade.
Though FÃ³dlan had changed, Hanneman's goal remained\nunwavering: to determine the workings of the Crests, and\nto do away with the inequality caused by them. To that\nend, his research resulted in magical tools which could be\nused even without the aid of Crests. This proved to be yet\nanother worthwhile discovery by the Father of Crestology.\nHanneman also became a father in more literal sense, by\nraising many children with his wife, Dorothea. Their\nmarriage was not publicly known, however, as the\nsongstress elected to keep it secret for the sake of both of\ntheir careers.
The Mittelfrank Opera Company was on the brink of\ncollapse until two of its star songstresses, Manuela and\nDorothea, returned to the stage and brought the troupe\nnew life and prominence. They toured all around FÃ³dlan,\nsometimes even visiting troops on the front lines, soothing\nhearts with their beautiful songs wherever they went, and\ndonating their profits to the relief and rebuilding effort.\nWhen the damage from the war had finally healed, the\npair once again retreated from the stage, this time retiring\nto a private life together. It is said that their relationship\nwas full of light and love.
Petra took Ashe with her to her homeland of Brigid, where\nshe inherited the throne from her grandfather. With Ashe's\nguidance, she established an order of knights, and used\nthat order to declare independence from FÃ³dlan and\nrenegotiate diplomatic ties on more equal terms. Over\nyears of work reforming diplomatic and military policy\ntogether, Petra and Ashe fell in love and eventually were\nmarried. The people of Brigid warmly embraced the\nunion. It is said that the name of the knightly order, the\nBlue Sun, was born of their mutual love of swimming in\nthe sea.
Petra returned to her homeland of Brigid, and inherited\nthe throne from her grandfather. As ruler, she declared\nindependence from FÃ³dlan, and renegotiated Brigid's\ndiplomatic ties to FÃ³dlan and Dagda on more equal terms.\nAt every step along the way, she was accompanied and\nsupported by her husband, Ignatz, who had left FÃ³dlan\nbehind to be with her. Trade with FÃ³dlan boomed under\nPetra's reign, thanks in no small part to the Victor Trading\nCompany. But while Ignatz was happy to support Petra's\ngoals, he remained focused on his work as an artist. His\npicturesque renditions of the Brigid landscape, done in the\nFÃ³dlan style, were held in high regard all over the world.
Petra returned to her homeland of Brigid, and inherited\nthe throne from her grandfather. As ruler, she declared\nindependence from FÃ³dlan, and renegotiated Brigid's\ndiplomatic ties on more equal terms. Some years later, the\nChurch of Seiros expanded its reach to Nuvelle, a town in\nwestern FÃ³dlan. The priest sent to this new church, for the\npurpose of keeping up relations with Brigid, was none\nother than Cyril. He and Petra met frequently, first for\npublic relations, and then for more private reasons. They\nfell in love, and were ultimately wed. It is said that their\nunion served as a symbol for the friendly ties between the\ntwo countries for the whole of their lives.
Though the innocence of the Duscur people was proven,\nprejudice against them still lingered in the Kingdom\ncapital. For this reason, Ashe refused a knighthood when it\nwas offered to him, and chose instead to open an inn that\nspecialized in Duscur cuisine. Dedue began to frequent\nthe place on breaks from his duty as the king's vassal, and\nover time, imparted to Ashe his culinary wisdom. As the\ninn gained popularity, the people of the Kingdom began\nfinally to see the Duscur people in a positive light. This\nled to a reconciliation between the two cultures that came\nrather more quickly than expected.
Two years after the war, Dedue and his wife, Mercedes,\nopened a school in the Duscur residential district in\nFhirdiad. The school educated Duscur children, who had\nnever been given structured learning before, in reading,\nwriting, arithmetic, and even Duscur history. Many years\nlater, when the Duscur people reclaimed their homeland,\nthe people who attended this school were able to resettle\nthere and revive their old culture. Because of this, Dedue\nand Mercedes were forever renowned by the Duscur.
Some time after the war, Dedue and Annette exchanged\nwedding vows in a modest ceremony and then settled\ndown to a life in Fhirdiad. For them, life after marriage\nstayed much the same as before. Dedue continued his duty\nto King Dimitri, and Annette took up a teaching position\nat Fhirdiad's school of sorcery. Though each gave the\nother space for the work that was important to them, they\nmade sure to spend much of their free time together, and\nto bond over the cooking and housework.
After the war, Dedue and Ingrid both served as protectors\nto the newly crowned King Dimitri: the former as his loyal\nvassal, and the latter as a knight sworn to House Blaiddyd.\nThe pair fought side by side on countless occasions, and\nwere known to be inseparable on the battlefield. Tales of\nthe taciturn vassal and the steadfast lady knight were\ntold by bards all throughout FÃ³dlan, and it is said that\ntheir friendship helped spark the reconciliation between\nthe peoples of Faerghus and Duscur.
After the war, Dedue returned to Fhirdiad to support\nKing Dimitri's reign as his vassal. As he worked, his wife,\nFlayn, was determined to support him with home-cooked\nmeals. Dedue patiently endured the more disastrous of his\nwife's experiments, while teaching her everything he knew.\nEventually Flayn's talent blossomed and she became\na renowned chef. It is said that those who were lucky\nenough to taste her cooking always asked for more, and\nthat Dedue's eyes lit up with affection and pride when she\ntold him what she was planning to prepare next.
After the war, Dedue returned to Fhirdiad to support\nKing Dimitri's reign as his vassal. Shamir was ever near,\nand as Dedue's trusted partner and a mercenary for the\nroyal family, she complemented his public-facing work\nwith by handling any necessary covert operations. The\ntrusting professional relationship between the two\nblossomed into love, and soon they were married. It is said\nthat, when absolutely no one else was around, they would\nlet down their guard and engage in secret jokes and\nidle chatter.
After the war, Felix and Sylvain inherited their respective\ntitles of Duke Fraldarius and Margrave Gautier, and set to\nwork restoring the Kingdom. Each led a busy life, but that\nonly seemed to enhance their friendship over the years.\nEach became known for making surprise visits to the estate\nof the other, in order to deliver the latest taunting in a\nfriendly but relentless game of one-upmanship. It is said\nthat, in their later years, they became so close that they\npassed away on the same day, as if conceding that one\ncould not live without the other.
Even after the war's end, skirmishes continued to break\nout across FÃ³dlan. Learning that there were still places\nwhere he could fight, Felix abandoned his noble title and\nchose to make a living with his sword. Decades later, he\nreunited briefly with Sylvain, who had need of his services\nas Margrave Gautier. Felix departed as soon as the job was\nfinished, however, and the two never met again. Years\nlater, a sword that was thought to have belonged to Felix\narrived on Sylvain's doorstep.
After the war, Felix inherited the title of Duke Fraldarius\nfrom his late father, Rodrigue. A year later he married\nMercedes, who helped complete the rebuilding effort by\npaying special attention to children who had lost their\nfamilies during the war. When their efforts were complete,\nthey settled into a busy life together, with Felix serving as\nthe king's trusted retainer, and Mercedes supporting him\nin all things. It is said that every so often, the pair would\nventure out of their territory in order to visit a graveyard\nfor fallen Imperial soldiers. There, they left flowers on a\nmysterious, unmarked grave, and prayed for the one who\nrested there.
Even after the war's end, skirmishes continued to break\nout across FÃ³dlan. Learning that there were still places\nwhere he could fight, Felix abandoned his noble title and\nchose to make a living with his sword. He traveled the\nland, seeking battle as if he had a death wish, but his\nviolent path came to an end when he reunited with\nMercedes. She had begun a new life as a cleric in service to\nthe goddess, and with her kindness and generosity, she was\nable to turn his life around. No one knows what became of\nthem after that, but the tales of a swordsman who made\nwarriors across FÃ³dlan tremble with fear all come to an\nend at that point.
After the war, Felix inherited the title of Duke Fraldarius\nfrom his late father, Rodrigue. Some time later, he married\nAnnette, and the pair earned renown together by working\nhard at restoring their territory to and beyond its former\nglory. The people adored the pair: Felix for his fierce\ndetermination, and Annette for her boundless cheer. Years\nlater, Annette threw herself into songwriting, and with the\nsupport and encouragement of her husband, she produced\nmelodies that remained popular for generations. The lyrics\nbecame distorted over time, however, and the original\nmeaning of the music was lost.
After the war, Felix intended to abandon his noble title\nand make a living with his sword. On the day that he was\nto depart, however, he was waylaid by Annette, who\nbegged him not to leave her behind. Instead, she proposed\nthat they relocate to the Officers Academy when it\nreopened, and take up positions as teachers. When the\nschool did reopen, it is said that the new sword instructor\nwas notoriously harsh, but that he eventually learned to\nenjoy his work. He was seen to smile, on occasion, but\nonly in the presence of the friendly professor of sorcery.
After the war, Felix inherited the title of Duke Fraldarius\nfrom his late father, Rodrigue. He married Ingrid, the\ndaughter of Count Galatea, and the couple spared no\nexpense in restoring both their territories, paying special\nattention to Galatea's desperate need for food and funds.\nSome years later, there was an attack on the castle town,\nand the duke lost the use of his sword arm from an injury\nsustained protecting his wife. It is said that he never\nregretted it, as he was only fulfilling a promise that he\nmade to his beloved wife a long time ago.
Even after the war's end, skirmishes continued to break\nout across FÃ³dlan. Learning that there were still places\nwhere he could fight, Felix abandoned his noble title and\nchose to make a living with his sword. Unwilling to leave\nhim to travel alone, Ingrid, too, relinquished her claim to\nnobility, and they both became wandering mercenaries.\nThey skirted the line between life and death countless\ntimes in their dangerous work, but once they had a child,\nthey settled down in a small farming village far from their\nhomeland. With all but each other left behind, they began\na warm and tranquil life as a family.
After becoming Duke Fraldarius, Felix married Lysithea,\nwho assisted his efforts to restore both his territory and the\nKingdom at large with countless insights. She became\nknown for walking among the people, sharing with them\nher wisdom. After her death, Felix received a visit from a\nlocal artisan, who brought to him a cake and claimed that\nLysithea had given him the recipe. Felix adored the flavor,\nenjoying that style of cake for the rest of his days. The\npeople acquired a taste for it too, and Lysithea's treat\nbecame traditional in the north of Faerghus.
After the war, Felix abandoned his noble title and chose to\nmake a living with his sword. He traveled the land, seeking\nbattle as if he had a death wish, but his violent path came\nto an end when he happened upon Lysithea, who had been\nliving in a small house in the middle of nowhere with her\nparents. Seeing herâcondemned to live a shortened life,\nbut smiling and making the most of every day with her\nfamilyâconvinced Felix that life was precious. He gave up\nhis sword to join her, and the two spent their lives baking\nsweets. Lysithea's recipe became known far and wide, and\nthe treat became a tradition for the people of that region.
Leonie took over the mercenary group formerly led by\nJeralt. She made a name for herself as a superb mercenary\nand was eventually hired by the young Duke Fraldarius,\nFelix. He entrusted her with many important tasks, and\nover time, Fraldarius territory became Leonie's home base.\nThe two spent a great deal of time drinking together, but\nFelix, knowing Leonie's reputation and habits, learned to\nextract her payment for the drinks in advance.
After the war, Felix abandoned his noble title and chose to\nmake a living with his sword. He accepted Leonie as his\npartner, and together they became wandering mercenaries.\nTheir different fighting styles complemented one another\nwell, and their combined skill was enough to handle any\nenemy. Some time later, the mercenary group formerly led\nby Jeralt joined them, and under their leadership, became\nthe most feared company in FÃ³dlan. After the post-war\nchaos passed, however, work became scarce, and the pair\neventually became so desperate that they rebranded\nthemselves as street performers. They proved surprisingly\ncapable in their new profession.
After becoming Duke Fraldarius, Felix married Flayn,\nand the couple worked tirelessly to restore their territory.\nThanks to Felix's dedication and Flayn's compassion, they\nwere well loved by the people, whom they visited and\nspoke with frequently. Felix served as Dimitri's sworn\nsword throughout his reign, but when the king passed\naway, he gave it up in favor of a quiet life with his wife.\nIn his later years, the sword was only used for parlor tricks,\nsuch as slicing juggled fruit out of the airâa display of\nskill that never failed to delight Flayn.
Even after the war's end, skirmishes continued to break\nout across FÃ³dlan. Learning that there were still places\nwhere he could fight, Felix abandoned his noble title and\nchose to make a living with his sword. He traveled the\nland, seeking battle as if he had a death wish, but his\nviolent path came to an end when he arrived at Garreg\nMach. It was there that he reunited with Flayn, who was\nsaddened to see that Felix had continued to use his sword\nto kill. She left to travel with him, and it is rumored that\nher kindness helped turn his life around. No one knows\nwhat became of them after that, but the tales of a deadly\nswordsman did suddenly cease.
After the war, Ashe was formally knighted and appointed\nthe new head of House Gaspard, which had no successors.\nThe young and inexperienced lord faced a great deal of\ndifficulty in governing. Though he was famously tenacious\nand never lost heart, it was perhaps only due to the\nconstant counsel of his wife, Mercedes, that he managed to\novercome all obstacles. When not busy governing their\nterritory, the couple lifted one another's spirits by baking\ndelicious sweets for each other. The tradition was so\nheartwarming that it became popular for husbands and\nwives in that region to do the same for generations.
After the war, Ashe was formally knighted and appointed\nthe new head of House Gaspard, which had no successors.\nHe married Annette, and the couple's combined tenacity,\nintelligence, and courage proved more than a match for\nthe many difficulties they faced in governing. Together\nthey helped Gaspard territory flourish more than it ever\nhad before. From his lowly origins as an orphan, Ashe\ngrew to become a splendid knight, much beloved by his\npeople. After he passed, his story was immortalized in a\nbook that was authored by his beloved wife.
When the new king was crowned in Faerghus, both Ashe\nand Ingrid left their homes to travel to Fhirdiad and\npledge themselves to the royal family as knights. They\neach swore to defend the king, come what may, no matter\nthe cost, and to that end they fought side by side in many\nbattles together. They were both praised for their endless\ndevotion and boundless courage, and their names went\ndown in history as peerless knights. Many tales were told\nof their valor, and how they became indispensable to each\nother over the years. A handful of those stories went so far\nas to suggest that they fell in love and became husband and\nwife, but this may have been an embellishment.
When Galatea territory was seized, Ingrid argued strongly\nfor the preservation of its borders. Her request was\ngranted and she was appointed to rule, but because she\nhad previously abandoned her noble house, she was not\nwell accepted by the people at first. It was thanks to the\nhelp of Ashe, who arrived to serve House Galatea, that she\nwas able to soften the view the people had toward her by\nrestoring the territory and improving its agriculture. As\nGalatea's prosperity grew, so too did the love between\nIngrid and Ashe. Their wedding ceremony was intended to\nbe a simple one, but lavish blessings from the citizenry\nmade it a lively event.
After the war, Ashe was formally knighted, and appointed\nthe new head of House Gaspard, which had no successors.\nThe young and inexperienced lord faced a great deal of\ndifficulty in governing, until his court was blessed with\na new adviser in Marianne. Using skills imparted to her by\nher adoptive father, Marianne helped Ashe to solidify his\nposition. As the prosperity of Gaspard territory grew, so\ndid a love between them, and soon Margrave Edmund saw\nfit to bless the couple's happy marriage. Years later, Ashe\nasked Marianne what made her choose to help him in the\nfirst place. She simply smiled and said that she decided to\nmake supporting him her dream.
When Rhea resigned her position of archbishop and left\nthe Church of Seiros, Catherine followed, and the pair\nbegan a life of seclusion in the Red Canyon. Years later,\nthey began to hear rumors of a wise young man who had\nbeen knighted and appointed lord of House Gaspard.\nSoon they were approached by that lord, Ashe, who came\nto the Red Canyon to kneel before Catherine and ask her\nto be his wife. With Rhea's encouragement, Catherine was\npersuaded to accept. She left the Red Canyon with him,\nand the two began their journey together.
After the war, Ashe was formally knighted and appointed\nthe new head of House Gaspard, which had no successors.\nHe asked Catherine, who had left the Knights of Seiros, to\nmarry him, but she declined, convinced that the people of\nGaspard territory would never accept it. Refusing to set\nhis love for Catherine aside, Ashe worked diligently along\nwith the Church of Seiros to expose the full truth of the\nWestern Church's plot. With great persistence, he\nconvinced the people of this truth, and then persuaded\nCatherine finally to reconsider. The people received her\nreluctantly at first, but over time, they recognized her\nvirtue and came to accept her.
After the war, Ashe was formally knighted and appointed\nthe new head of House Gaspard, which had no successors.\nThe young and inexperienced lord faced a great deal of\ndifficulty in governing, until his court was blessed with\na new adviser in Cyril.

The pair swore always to be\nthere to help one another, and remained best friends for\nthe whole of their lives.
As Margrave Gautier, Sylvain devoted his life to improving\nrelations with the people of Sreng. Under his leadership,\nnobles were persuaded that Relics and Crests were not\nnecessary as they'd previously thought. Though he went\ndown in history as an extraordinary lord, he could not\nhave done so without the constant support and counsel of\nhis wife, Mercedes, whose wisdom and guidance brought\nprosperity to the people. The couple built a loving home\nlife, surrounded by happy children, and when Sylvain at\nlast passed away, he was succeeded by his oldest child, who\nbore no Crest.

After the war, Annette and Mercedes lived separate lives:\nthe former as a teacher at the school of sorcery in Fhirdiad,\nthe latter as a cleric at Garreg Mach. Though they lived\napart, they exchanged letters so frequently and shared\ntheir lives with one another in such detail that it was as\nthough they were side by side. After many decades, they\nresigned their respective positions and reunited at Garreg\nMach. In their final years, they relocated to a modest\nhouse in the Fortress City. It is said that they were happy\ntogether to the very end.
After the war, Mercedes accompanied Lorenz back to his\nhomeland. There, the young heir petitioned his father,\nCount Gloucester, to permit the couple to marry. Though\nthe count initially disapproved of Mercedes's status as a\ncommoner, he was persuaded by her virtues as a person to\nchange his mind. In fact, he praised Lorenz for having a\ntaste in character superior to his own. After Lorenz\nsucceeded his father as lord of the territory, the couple\nfinally wed. With Lorenz's stern approach to governance,\nand Mercedes's open mind, House Gloucester flourished\nunder their rule.
Mercedes left home and opened a small orphanage in the\nFaerghus region with her mother. There, she took in and\nraised children who had lost their families in the war,\nregardless of their blood or circumstances of birth. Some\nyears later, she was reunited with Ignatz, who had\npersuaded his family that he should become a painter and\ntraveled all through FÃ³dlan painting beautiful landscapes.\nHis greatest masterpiece, however, was a portrait that was\nentitled The Smiling Saint. It is said that the woman\nwhose face inspired it became the love of his life, and that\nshe spent all of her remaining days close by his side.

Mercedes left home for a life as a cleric at Garreg Mach.\nAlois, as Jeralt's successor, officially assumed the role of\ncaptain of the Knights of Seiros. Though the two were\nquite busy with their daily activities, they would often find\ntime to get together in the evenings so Alois could hear\nMercedes's ghost stories. No one can say for certain\nwhether it was the constant exposure to spooky tales or\nsome other cause, but from that time on, Alois's reputation\nbecame that of a totally fearless fighter. Mercedes's quiet\nsupport was widely credited for this increase in bravery.\nHer blessing came to be known as a guarantee of victory.
After the war, Annette and Hanneman both accepted\nteaching positions at Fhirdiad's school of sorcery. There,\nwhile educating the next generation of mages, they made\ngreat strides in their research of Crests and magic.\nWorking side by side, the pairâformerly teacher and\nstudent, now partners and colleaguesâbrought great\nprogress to the world and prestige to their institution. It is\nsaid that the wait list for students to enroll in either of\ntheir classes was notoriously long.
Gustave discarded the name of Gilbert and reaffirmed his\noath of fealty to King Dimitri and the royal family. After\nreturning to Fhirdiad, he reunited with his wife, who had\nreturned to live with Baron Dominic, and his beloved\ndaughter, Annette, who had begun teaching at the capital's\nschool of sorcery. Though it was initially an awkward\nreunion, over time the family rekindled their love for one\nanother. As the shadow of war receded from the Kingdom,\nthe three spent their days happily making up for lost time.
Raphael returned to his home town to serve his liege lord\nas a knight, and spent his spare time helping out at the inn\nthat his grandfather and sister had opened during his time\naway. One day, Ingrid, who had abandoned her claim to\nHouse Galatea to serve as a knight to the royal family,\narrived to persuade Raphael to join her. It did not take\nmuch convincing. From that day forward, they served\ntogether as partners, fighting together side by side to make\ntheir mark on the history of Faerghus.
When Galatea territory was seized, Ingrid argued strongly\nfor the preservation of its borders. Her request was\ngranted, and she was appointed to rule. Soon after,\nRaphael traveled there to pledge his service to Ingrid. He\ninitially signed on as a knight, but quickly discovered that\nhis services were even more desperately needed by the\nland's farmers, and instead focused his efforts on helping\nGalatea improve its agriculture. Seeing him work side by\nside with the commonfolk, Ingrid became enamored with\nRaphael's character, and eventually asked for his hand in\nmarriage. They held a modest but lively wedding, and the\npeople happily gave their blessing to the union.
Ingrid declined to rule House Galatea, choosing instead\nto serve House Blaiddyd as a knight. As Faerghus worked\nwith the Church of Seiros to advance policy, Ingrid served\nas an envoy between the two. In this capacity, she met\nroutinely with Seteth, whose complete trust in Ingrid\nresulted in fruitful negotiations. Together, Faerghus and\nthe church coordinated extensive relief efforts to return\nprosperity to FÃ³dlan. After they had accomplished what\nthey set out to do, it is said that Ingrid and Seteth settled\ndown together in a small village, where they spent their\ndays in peace, farming and fishing.
As the new head of House Gloucester, Lorenz first worked\nto restore his own territory, and then expanded his vision\nto include reforms for all FÃ³dlan.

At the height of his\nstoried political career, he announced his marriage to\nCatherine, the former Knight of Seiros. Catherine had\nleft Garreg Mach behind for a life of freedom, but was\neventually persuaded to accept Lorenz's passionate\nmarriage proposal. Even after joining House Gloucester\nand returning to a life among the nobility, however, it is\nsaid that Catherine much preferred relaxing in a tavern to\ndressing up for court.
Raphael returned to his hometown to serve his liege lord\nas a knight, and spent his spare time helping out at the inn\nthat his family had opened during his time away. He was\ncompelled to give up knighthood and manage the inn\nfull-time, however, when his sister Maya suddenly\ndeclared her ambition to become an artist and vanished.\nYears later, when she finally returned, she did so in the\ncompany of another artist: her husband, Ignatz. With\ncheerful support from Raphael's family, Ignatz and his\nwife rose to prominence and, with their unique style,\nset the artistic paradigm in FÃ³dlan for a generation.
Raphael returned to his hometown to serve his liege lord\nas a knight, and spent his spare time helping out at the inn\nthat his family had opened during his time away. Due to\nhis grandfather's age, he was compelled before long to give\nup knighthood and manage the inn full-time. Soon after\nthat, the inn began to be frequented by Lysithea and her\nfamily, who had renounced all claim to nobility and begun\na life as commoners. Lysithea found a kindred spirit in\nRaphael's sister, Maya, and before long, found herself\nhelping out around the place too. Eventually she was put\nin charge of the kitchen, where it is said she spent the rest\nof her days happily working.
Raphael returned to his hometown, where he served his\nliege lord as a knight for a time. Later, he gave it up to\npursue his true passion of food by opening up an inn.\nHe got the idea to install a bird feeder outside the place,\ncalling it The Winged Inn & Tavern, and before long, the\nsite began to attract the prettiest birds in the region.\nSoon after that, Marianne made her first visit, and she\nand Raphael enjoyed a happy reunion. Seeing her gift in\ntalking to the birds, he invited her to stay. Marianne\neventually became known as the woman whose talent for\nhandling animals helped an inn to flourish.
Raphael returned to his hometown, where he served his\nliege lord as a knight for a time. Later, he gave it up to\nhelp manage the inn that his family had opened up during\nhis time away. One day, to the great joy of Raphael's sister,\nMaya, Hilda came to visit. Maya had always treasured the\nnecklace Hilda had made for her. Moved by this, Hilda\ngave Maya a new gift of a hair band, which inspired Maya\nto suggest that Raphael convert the inn into an accessory\nshop. Hilda decided to stay and help out, and eventually\nbecame the shop's proprietor and chief artisan. She moved\nin with Raphael, and the two spent their lives happily\ndealing in fashionable accessories.
Leonie took over the mercenary company formerly led by\nJeralt. She ran out of money constantly, however, due to\nsending all of her earnings back to her village, and so\ndeveloped a reputation for unpaid tavern tabs. When she\ncame upon the inn that Raphael had been helping to run\nwith his family, she was overjoyed to finally find a place\nthat would trust her enough to open a new tab. In her\nyears frequenting the establishment, she accrued such a\nmassive debt to Raphael that the only way to pay him off\nwas to work for him. By the time the debt was finally paid,\nshe had moved in with him. They lived together happily\nfor the rest of their days.
Raphael returned to his hometown, where he served his\nliege lord as a knight for a time. Later, he gave it up to\nhelp manage the inn that his family had opened up during\nhis time away. Away from the battlefield and able to eat as\nmuch as he pleased, he eventually began to grow soft. It\nwas around that time that Flayn, who had also neglected\nher training, came to visit. The two helped motivate one\nanother, and together they embarked on a new exercise\nroutine. Thereafter, it is said that their energetic shouts\nand cries of exertion could be heard throughout the\nvillage at any time of day.
Shortly after the war, Shamir gave up the mercenary life\nand disappeared. Raphael searched for her unsuccessfully\nfor a time, but then gave up and returned home to serve\nhis liege lord as a knight. One day, he was given orders to\ndrive off a group of bandits, but upon investigation, he\ndiscovered that all of the bandits' victims were those who\nlined their pockets by preying upon the innocent. Without\nwarning, Raphael resigned his post, said good-bye to his\nfamily, and vanished forever. It is unclear just where he\nwent, but rumors swirled for years of a master archer and a\nhulking giant who spent their lives as highway robbers,\nshaking down those who made victims of others.
Lysithea returned home to help her parents restore their\nfamily land. Years later, when the end to their hard work\nwas finally in sight, she relinquished House Ordelia's claim\nto nobility, and the family retreated from the public eye.\nIn her new life as a commoner, she had a chance reunion\nwith Ignatz, who had persuaded his family to allow him to\ntravel the world as an artist. Lysithea became enchanted by\nhis determination, and by the landscapes and portraits he\npainted of all he had seen in his travels. She offered the\nremainder of her short life in support of his work. It is said\nthat Ignatz's most famous piece, Portrait of a Goddess,\nused Lysithea's face as a reference.
Marianne returned home to a warm welcome from her\nadoptive father, who recognized her wisdom and skill and\nbegan to groom her as his successor. During that time, she\nhad a chance reunion with Ignatz, who had persuaded his\nfamily to allow him to travel the world as an artist.\nMarianne wholeheartedly supported his work, and before\nlong, came to be enchanted not merely by the landscapes\nand portraits of all he had seen in his travels, but also by\nhis character. The romance between artist and patron was\nconsidered unusual, but long after their wedding, the story\nof how they fell in love was immortalized in popular plays.
After Hilda returned home, her fashionable accessories\nachieved widespread popularity, leading her to create the\nfirst artisan academy in FÃ³dlan. While shopping for art\nsupplies, she had a chance reunion with Ignatz, who had\npersuaded his family to allow him to travel the world as\nan artist. Hilda invited Ignatz to teach at her school,\nand as she and the students became enchanted by the\nlandscapes and portraits of all he had seen in his travels,\nthe two gradually fell in love. Their romance birthed a\nnew style that inspired artists in FÃ³dlan for generations.
Leonie took over the mercenary company formerly led by\nJeralt. Though she earned a great deal of renown, the\nwork began to dry up as the postwar chaos subsided. It was\naround that time she had a chance reunion with Ignatz,\nwho had persuaded his family to allow him to wander the\nworld as an artist. Remembering how they had once\npromised to travel together, Leonie disbanded her\nmercenary company and resolved to accompany him.\nThe pair left FÃ³dlan, searching for sights hitherto unseen.\nWhere their journey took them remains unknown.
Soon after the war, Flayn disappeared. Ignatz searched\nunsuccessfully for her for a time, but finally gave up and\nwent home. With hard-won permission from his family, he\nthen set out to travel the world as an artist. Years later, his\njourney took him by chance to Garreg Mach, where the\nstatue of Saint Cethleann inspired him to paint. It was\nthen that Flayn finally appeared, wondering aloud why\nIgnatz was not painting her as he'd promised. Overjoyed,\nIgnatz devoted much of the rest of his artistic career to\ngetting Flayn's likeness just right. Her visage was finally\ncaptured in the work he called The Second Advent of a\nSaint, which was widely regarded as a masterpiece.
Soon after the war, Shamir disappeared. Ignatz searched\nunsuccessfully for her for a time, but finally gave up and\nwent home. With hard-won permission from his family, he\nthen set out to travel the world as an artist. Years later, he\nencountered Shamir by chance at an inn. When she saw\nthat Ignatz had not yet left FÃ³dlan, she encouraged him to\nleave the region, and offered to stay at his side and guard\nhim until he did. It is rumored that he was overjoyed by\nthis offer, and that the pair soon departed FÃ³dlan to the\nwest by sea, but where they traveled after that is unknown.
After the war, Lysithea returned to her parents in Ordelia\nterritory. She was joined by Hanneman, and together the\ntwo worked to research a method by which to extend her\nlifespan. Some years later, their efforts bore fruit, and they\ndevised a procedure to remove her Crests. Afterward,\nLysithea renounced her noble claim and continued to\nassist Hanneman with his research. When he passed, she\ntook up his mantle, and by the great discoveries she made,\ncame to be called the Golden Child of Crestology.
Lysithea returned home to help her parents restore their\nfamily land. Years later, when their work was at an end,\nshe journeyed to Garreg Mach to inform the church of her\ndecision to relinquish House Ordelia's claim to nobility.\nThere she encountered Cyril, who had since graduated\nfrom the Officers Academy and joined the Knights of\nSeiros. During their reunion, Cyril confessed his love to\nLysithea and asked her to marry him. She declined, at first,\ndue to her shortened lifespan, but in the face of Cyril's\ninsistence, she chose to spend what days she had remaining\ntogether with him. Where they went is unknown, but it is\nsaid that, for however long it lasted, they were happy.
After returning to their respective homes, Hilda and\nMarianne stayed in touch and deepened their friendship\nthrough letters. Hilda informed Marianne that her passion\nfor crafting fashionable accessories had given her the idea\nto start an artisan academy, and in response, Marianne\npledged the financial support of the house of Margrave\nEdmund. Soon, artisan schools began to appear all over\nFÃ³dlan, producing talented craftsmen and high-quality\ntrade goods, which contributed greatly to the prosperity\nof FÃ³dlan. The accessories sent to Marianne personally by\nHilda became some of the most highly valued treasures\nin history.
After the war, Marianne and Hanneman stayed in touch\nand deepened their friendship through letters. When\nHanneman's Crest research fell on hard times, Marianne\nwas able to secure Margrave Edmund's financial support to\nallow his work to continue. The research bore fruit in the\nform of magical tools which could be used even without\nthe aid of Crests, and the funding allowed these tools to be\nproduced in great number. After Marianne inherited her\nadoptive father's house, she guided Hanneman to create a\nbranch of research devoted to peaceful applications of\nCrestology. These advancements, which Hanneman\nprovided, became the legacy of Marianne's later years.
After the war, Seteth dedicated himself to the restoration\nof the church. He continued to write fables for children in\nhis spare time, but became dissatisfied with the hobby\ndue to a lack of quality illustrations for his work. When\nHilda learned of this, she jumped at the chance to visit\nGarreg Mach and illustrate some of Seteth's newer stories\nfor him. The completed fables were distributed far and\nwide, and the children who loved them eventually passed\nthe famous and beloved works on to their own children\nand grandchildren.
Hilda returned to her territory, and founded the first\nartisan academy in FÃ³dlan. Years later, as the successful\nheadmaster of that school, she journeyed to Garreg Mach\nto make a donation to the church. There she encountered\nCyril, who had graduated from the Officers Academy and\njoined the Knights of Seiros. When each saw how much\nthe other had grown and matured, a mutual attraction\nbetween them blossomed naturally into love. Cyril\neventually left the church to become a knight of House\nGoneril, at the invitation of Hilda's brother, Holst.\nAs Holst's new brother-in-law, Cyril provided essential aid\nin negotiations with House Goneril's Almyran neighbors.
While Seteth remained at the monastery after the war to\nrestore the Church of Seiros, Leonie wandered the land in\npursuit of her dream to become an elite mercenary. It\nseemed as if their paths would never cross again. Years\nlater, after they had achieved their goals, both retired and\ndisappeared from the public eye at the same time, as if it\nhad been prearranged. Though no official records of their\nlives after that time exist, it is rumored that a happy couple\nresembling them was sighted in a small mountain village.\nThe couple was known for their excellent fishing skills,\nand for cooking up their bountiful catches for all the local\nvillagers and travelers.
Leonie joined up with the mercenaries formerly led by\nJeralt. As his greatest apprentice, she quickly took on a\nleadership role, and eventually even inherited the title of\nBlade Breaker. No matter where she went, however, she\nwas burdened with Jeralt's unpaid tavern tabs. Angry with\nAlois for pushing these debts upon her, she went to see\nhim with the intention of forcing him to pay half the debt.\nBut when she arrived, she found a suntanned Alois happily\nlounging after a hard day's work on his family farm. Leonie\nfound herself unable to go through with it. She did become\na world-renowned mercenary, but she spent the whole\nof her career paying off debt.

No matter where she went, however, she\nwas burdened with Jeralt's unpaid tavern tabs. Angry with\nAlois for pushing these debts upon her, she went to Garreg\nMach to force him to pay half the debt. She encountered a\nsmiling Alois, who had become captain of the Knights of\nSeiros, and who was all too happy in his new prosperity to\ntake the debts back on. It is said that Leonie developed\nquite the drinking habit once she was free to visit taverns\nwhenever she liked.
Leonie assumed leadership of the mercenaries formerly led\nby Jeralt. One day, she was hired to protect a noble who\nhad been warned of a bandit attack. The warning note\nlisted all of the noble's foul deeds, and was signed with the\nimage of a spider, which Leonie recognized. Just as she\nsuspected, the one who came on the appointed day was\nnone other than Shamir. Leonie was happy to break her\ncontract on this occasion, and even offered Shamir a\nposition in her company. The result was the most famous\nmercenary group ever to exist in FÃ³dlan. It is said that \ntheir flag bore the image of a spider, and...another vaguely\narachnid creature.
While Flayn disappeared soon after the war, Seteth stayed\nat the monastery and worked to restore the authority of\nthe Church of Seiros. Doing away with his old strictness,\nhe adopted a tolerant stance toward all, and encouraged\nhis followers to do the same. When he was satisfied that\nthe message was received, he vanished from the monastery.\nSeveral centuries later, a man and a woman in ancient\nattire emerged to a FÃ³dlan that had drastically changed.\nWhen she asked the man beside her if it would be all right\nin this new era to call him "Father," he said that perhaps it\nwould be better to remain on the safe side.
After the war, Seteth remained at the monastery to rebuild\nthe church. Several years of hard restorative work later, he\nreceived a letter from Manuela. She wrote that she had\ntraveled to a small, war-torn town and opened up a school\nfor children. Reminded of the beauty and compassion in\nManuela's heart, Seteth was moved to leave the monastery\nand join her there. As they worked together to manage the\nbudding institution, the couple fell in love and eventually\nwere married. It is said that their students were overjoyed.
After the war, Seteth fully confessed his love to Catherine\nand asked her to marry him. Intending to accompany Rhea\nto a life of seclusion, however, Catherine declined. Over\nthe years, as Seteth worked to rebuild the church from the\nmonastery, he continued to write love letters to Catherine.\nWhen the rebuilding effort was complete, he journeyed to\nthe Red Canyon, where she and Rhea had been living, and\ndelivered all of his letters by hand. Catherine was deeply\nmoved, and with Rhea's blessing and no more reason to\nrefuse him, she accepted his proposal. The two were wed\nand lived out their lives happily alongside Rhea.
After the war, Seteth fully confessed his love to Catherine\nand asked her to marry him. Refusing to remain at the\nmonastery, however, Catherine declined. Over the years,\nas Seteth worked to rebuild the church, he continued to\nwrite love letters to Catherine. Her answer was always the\nsame. Finally, when the rebuilding effort was complete,\nSeteth left the church and went to see her, declaring his\nlove anew. With no more reason to refuse him, she at last\naccepted his proposal. The two were wed, and swore to\nwalk side by side together through the new age.
After the war, Hanneman and Manuela held a grand\nwedding ceremony, to which all of their many students\nwere invited. Later, after the church was transformed and\nrehabilitated under the supervision of the Empire, the\nOfficers Academy finally reopened, with a renewed focus\non accepting students regardless of status and offering\nclasses on a wider variety of practical subjects. Hanneman\nand Manuela returned to work as teachers, almost as if\nnothing had changed, and filled the halls with their banter\nin the way only married couples can.

Their relationship\nspawned a trend of romances among colleagues at the\nOfficers Academy, but that is an entirely different story.
Alois officially took up the title of captain of the Knights\nof Seiros. In this new role, he led the knights to many\nvictories, and was much beloved. At the same time, he\ndeveloped a reputation for gullibility, and his subordinates\nbegan to play tricks on him regularly. To help him deal\nwith this, Catherine volunteered her services as an adviser.\nShe kept a lookout for him, and put a stop to these antics\nbefore they began. The combination of the kindly captain\nand the intimidating wielder of Thunderbrand proved\nstrong, and the Knights of Seiros prospered.
After quitting the Knights of Seiros, Catherine and Shamir\nset out on a lifelong journey together. The pair were\ninseparable as they traveled across FÃ³dlan, and eventually\nwound up in Shamir's homeland of Dagda. They faced\nmany hardships on their adventures, some of which were\nself-inflicted, as the duo had a way of sticking their noses\ninto others' business in their efforts to right wrongs. It is\nsaid, however, that no foe they encountered ever proved\na match for the combined might of Shamir's marksmanship\nand Catherine's Thunderbrand.
Shortly after the war, Shamir and Cyril disappeared from\nthe ranks. The Knights of Seiros searched unsuccessfully\nfor them for some time, but finally resigned themselves to\nthe loss. Though the pair was never officially heard from\nagain, rumors swirled persistently for years of two master\narchers turned thieves. Initially the knights received\ncomplaints and investigated, but when it was discovered\nthat the pair only lined their pockets by shaking down\nthose who preyed upon the innocent, they decided it was\nnot an investigation worth pursuing. The thieves' story\nbecame a folktale beloved by the people.

Ingrid declined to rule House Galatea, choosing instead\nto serve House Blaiddyd as a knight. Some years later, she\nwas reunited by chance with Ignatz, who had persuaded\nhis family that he should become a painter and traveled all\nthrough FÃ³dlan painting beautiful landscapes. Ignatz\ndecided to paint Ingrid that day, and spent much of the\nrest of his career working to get her likeness just right.\nThere were many depictions of her bravery in battle, of\ncourse, but later generations would most fondly remember\nthe way he captured her smile, which was widely believed\nto be that of a loving wife.
When Galatea territory was seized, Ingrid argued strongly\nfor the preservation of its borders. Her request was\ngranted, and she was appointed to rule, but because she\nhad previously abandoned her noble house, she was not\nwell accepted by the people. It was thanks to Ignatz that\nthe mood of the people finally softened. He showed them,\nthrough his artwork, a side of Ingrid that they had not yet\nseen: her valor and bravery, fighting in defense of FÃ³dlan.\nThe people were moved, first by the artwork itself, and\nlater by the woman who had inspired it. As time passed,\nand the region prospered, Ingrid and Ignatz bonded over\ntheir reunion. They fell in love and eventually were wed.
After the war, Annette and Mercedes lived separate lives:\nthe former as a teacher at the school of sorcery in Fhirdiad,\nthe latter as the proprietor of an orphanage in a village in\nthe Faerghus region. Though they lived apart, they\nexchanged letters so frequently and shared their lives with\none another in such detail that it was as though they were\nside by side. After many decades, Annette decided to\nresign from her post and move to the village where\nMercedes lived to help run the orphanage. The life they\nlived there was modest, but it is said that they were happy\nto the very end.
This is a relationship that reaches support level A but has\nno further developments.
