b'\x1bS0 fought alongside Edelgard to bring\nan end to the tyranny of a godlike being. Though \x1bEK00he\x1bEL00she\x1bEM00\nwas wounded in the battle and lost the power of the\nprogenitor god, \x1bEK00he\x1bEL00she\x1bEM00 remained determined to walk \x1bEK00his\x1bEL00her\x1bEM00\ndestined path. With \x1bEK00his\x1bEL00her\x1bEM00 legendary blade in hand,\n\x1bEK00he\x1bEL00she\x1bEM00 will never stop standing against those who slither\nin the dark until F\xc3\xb3dlan at last knows everlasting peace.'
b"\x1bS0 defeated those who slither in the dark\nand put down the crazed Immaculate One.

In \x1bEK00his\x1bEL00her\x1bEM00 heart lived the\nindelible hope that their efforts would one day yield\nan era in which the people knew true peace and the\nhorrors of war were a hazy memory of the past."

After the war, Rhea stepped\ndown from her role as archbishop, and \x1bS0\nswore to lead the Church of Seiros in her stead.\n\x1bEK00He\x1bEL00She\x1bEM00 helped to guide the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus\nas it brought leadership to the newly unified F\xc3\xb3dlan\nand worked tirelessly to create a peaceful world\nfree from the shackles of oppression.'
b'Together, \x1bS0 and Claude sent the Fell King\nNemesis, a foe from a bygone age, back to the flames of\neternity from whence he came. Afterward, Claude left\nF\xc3\xb3dlan, leaving \x1bS0 to ascend the throne\nas the first leader of the United Kingdom of F\xc3\xb3dlan.\nAs he took his schemes and dreams and efforts to a\nfar-off land, he hoped dearly that their joint efforts\nwould one day allow for a world where all of humanity\ncan coexist in peace and harmony, regardless of\nborders or bloodlines.'
b"As the new Adrestian emperor, Edelgard dedicated her life\nto reshaping the delicate political structure of F\xc3\xb3dlan.\nWith tireless work and great sacrifice, she reformed\nthe class system to ensure a free and independent society\nfor all.

Under his\nguidance, the peoples of F\xc3\xb3dlan and Almyra were finally\nable to set aside age-old prejudices, and over time,\nthe fallacies of old were all but forgotten.'
b'Hubert devoted his life fully to the service of Edelgard.\nOperating in the light and the shadows alike, he disposed\nof countless burdens facing his emperor, using any means\nnecessary.

b'After the war, Caspar set out alone on a journey of\nself-discovery. He traveled to every corner of F\xc3\xb3dlan and\neven ventured abroad now and again.

b'As soon as Bernadetta inherited House Varley from her\nfather, she withdrew from all political discourse and\nfocused solely on the management of her own territory.\nBecause of this and her penchant for spending long\nperiods of time in "hibernation," she became known\nthroughout the house\'s history as the "Bear of Varley."'
b'Dorothea returned to the Mittelfrank Opera as soon as the\nwar was over. Thanks to her talent, the company enjoyed a\nresurgence in popularity that lasted well beyond the end\nof her own career.

b"Even after the war's end, skirmishes continued to break\nout across F\xc3\xb3dlan. Bored and restless in his capacity as\nDuke Fraldarius, Felix abandoned his title, jumping at\nthe opportunity to wield a sword again.

b"Marianne returned home to a hero's welcome. The people\npraised her talent and acknowledged her as a savior of\nF\xc3\xb3dlan.

As leaders of church\nand state respectively, at times they engaged in heated\ndebate. Even still, when enjoying a long horse ride or a\nquiet evening, they were not as the world saw them,\nbut rather two adoring spouses, desperately in love.\nThey remained as such for the rest of their days.'
b'After ascending the throne as the first leader of the United\nKingdom of F\xc3\xb3dlan, \x1bS0 sought to rebuild\nthe war-torn towns and villages and to help guide the\nreformation of the Church of Seiros.

This show of solidarity forever\naltered the course of history, heralding a new age of unity.'
b'After a fierce battle, \x1bS0 and Edelgard finally\nbrought the tyranny of a godlike being to an end.

Ferdinand overcame a slew of\nobstacles to reform his territory and that of House Hrym.\nHe chose not to accept an official position in service to\n\x1bS0, instead advising her only informally as\na spouse. History books extol Ferdinand's success as a lord\nof his territories, but make no mention of his marriage.\nThus, half of his life's work is lost to time."
b"After taking her place as the new archbishop of the\nChurch of Seiros, \x1bS0 announced her\nmarriage to Ferdinand, who had assumed his place as\nDuke Aegir.

The people of F\xc3\xb3dlan placed\nhigh expectations on their leader's spouse, but to their\nconsternation, Linhardt spent most of his time fishing,\nrelaxing, and researching Crests. Fortunes turned when\n\x1bS0 discovered a document, hidden away\non Linhardt's desk, which provided a ground-breaking\ndiscovery.

b'Though grateful for the end of the war, \x1bS0\nand Linhardt were disappointed to see that there was no\ntime to relax. The fight against those who slither in the\ndark began immediately, and Linhardt abandoned his\nterritory to help fight for a world of peace and quiet.\nThough the struggle was bitter, he took heart in the\nknowledge that once it was over, he and \x1bS0\ncould spend the rest of their days in leisure, chasing\nidle pursuits far away from the stage of battle.'
b'After ascending to the throne as the first leader of the\nUnited Kingdom of F\xc3\xb3dlan, \x1bS0 announced\n\x1bEK00his\x1bEL00her\x1bEM00 marriage to Caspar. But Caspar, never one to sit still\nfor long, set out on a journey of self-discovery. He traveled\nto every corner of F\xc3\xb3dlan and even took \x1bS0\nalong on occasion. It is said that he got into mischief at\nevery turn, and that his wife sometimes had to invoke\nher authority to defuse the situation, but that the victims\nof his antics always came away more amused than harmed\nor offended in the end.

b"Almost immediately after \x1bS0 and Caspar\nhad celebrated their marriage in style, the battle against\nthose who slither in the dark began in earnest. As the new\nMinister of Military Affairs, Caspar worked with\n\x1bS0 to command the Imperial army and\nbring peace to F\xc3\xb3dlan.

b"\x1bS0 announced \x1bEK00his\x1bEL00her\x1bEM00 marriage to Manuela\nshortly after being named archbishop of the Church of\nSeiros. Manuela lent her considerable experience and\ntalent to the rebuilding effort, using personal connections\nshe'd gained during her time as a songstress and teacher to\nassemble a team of talented people to restore the church.\nShe became essential to the archbishop, and her skills as a\nphysician kept him in good health for many years. The\nhappiness of the couple and their children was plain to see\non the faces that were immortalized in family portraits."
b'Very soon after \x1bS0 and Manuela had\nfinished their grand and elaborate wedding ceremony, the\nstruggle against those who slither in the dark began in\nearnest. The pair fought in many battles together, but\nManuela had to leave the front lines when she discovered\nthat she was with child. Though they spent many days\napart, the family reunited once true peace had come to\nF\xc3\xb3dlan. The happiness of their family was plain to see on\nthe faces that were immortalized in their family portraits.'
b"When \x1bS0 took on the role of archbishop\nin Rhea's place, \x1bEK00he\x1bEL00she\x1bEM00 devoted \x1bEK00himself\x1bEL00herself\x1bEM00 to official business\nas the new leader of the Church of Seiros. Reaching an\nagreement with the Kingdom, \x1bEK00he\x1bEL00she\x1bEM00 worked tirelessly on\nthe restoration and development of all of F\xc3\xb3dlan. Behind\n\x1bEK00his\x1bEL00her\x1bEM00 achievements was the knight Gustave, formerly known\nas Gilbert of the Knights of Seiros, who remained always\nby the archbishop's side. \x1bS0 came to rely\non Gustave for nearly everything. It is said that \x1bEK00he\x1bEL00she\x1bEM00\ncontinued to call upon Gustave for instruction and advice\nwell into his retirement."
b"After the war, \x1bS0 ascended the throne of\nthe United Kingdom of F\xc3\xb3dlan, and Alois retired from the\nKnights of Seiros to serve the former professor. Alois\nbecame the new leader's right hand, and his duties in\nthat respect kept him busily engaged all over F\xc3\xb3dlan,\ngiving all he had to support \x1bEK00his\x1bEL00her\x1bEM00 reign. Alois's cheerful \ncharacter was beloved by his subordinates, who rallied\nbehind him to create the most numerous order of knights\nin all F\xc3\xb3dlan. It is said that \x1bS0 relied on\nAlois as though he were \x1bEK00his\x1bEL00her\x1bEM00 own father."
b"When \x1bS0 took on the role of archbishop\nin Rhea's place, \x1bEK00he\x1bEL00she\x1bEM00 reformed the order of the church little\nby little. Eventually this included the Knights of Seiros,\nand Alois was named captain and the archbishop's right\nhand. The captain's duties kept him busily engaged all\nover F\xc3\xb3dlan. His cheerful character inspired those under\nhis command, unifying the Knights of Seiros in a way they\nhad never been before. The archbishop relied on Alois as\nif he were \x1bEK00his\x1bEL00her\x1bEM00 father, and Alois in turn treated \x1bEK00him\x1bEL00her\x1bEM00 like his\nchild. It is said that Alois was so overcome with emotion\non the archbishop's wedding day that his weeping\ncould be heard through the applause."
b"When all of the fighting was over, \x1bS0\nembarked on another wandering journey as a mercenary.\nHe traveled all over F\xc3\xb3dlan, following his father's steps.\nWhen he at last drifted into Remire Village, he was\nreunited with Alois, who had moved there with his family\nand was now living on a farm. On Alois's advice, he\ndecided to stay a while, and before he knew it, five years\nhad passed. He fell in love with a kind woman in the\nvillage, and they had a modest wedding. It is said that\nAlois was so overcome with emotion on that day that his\nweeping could be heard from anywhere in the village."

b'\x1bS0 announced \x1bEK00his\x1bEL00her\x1bEM00 marriage to Catherine\nshortly after becoming leader of the United Kingdom\nof F\xc3\xb3dlan. While the king focused on the rebuilding effort,\nCatherine worked as his bodyguard, and when the\nsituation called for military force, she mobilized the troops\nand went to battle. Under her watchful eye, F\xc3\xb3dlan\nentered a new era of peace. A common saying among the\npeople was that the king of F\xc3\xb3dlan had two weapons:\nthe Sword of the Creator, and his fearsome wife.'

While the king focused on the rebuilding effort,\nShamir became his bodyguard and confidant. She even\nacted as captain of the royal guard, and became known as\na watchful and trustworthy queen. As a couple, their daily\nlives were busy indeed, and both were famously taciturn,\nbut it is said that they cherished their quiet time\ntogether\xe2\x80\x94especially once they began to have children.'

As a couple,\ntheir daily lives were busy indeed, and both were famously\ntaciturn, but it is said that they cherished their quiet time\ntogether\xe2\x80\x94especially once they began to have children.'
b'Shortly after \x1bS0 and Shamir had finished\ntheir modest and stately wedding ceremony, the struggle\nagainst those who slither in the dark began in earnest. The\npair fought in many battles together, and Shamir lent her\ntalent and experience as a sniper for the Knights of Seiros\nto the cause of lasting peace for F\xc3\xb3dlan. As a couple, their\ndaily lives were busy indeed, and both were famously\ntaciturn, but it is said that they cherished their quiet time\ntogether\xe2\x80\x94especially once they began to have children.'
b"\x1bS0 declared the founding of the United\nKingdom of F\xc3\xb3dlan at Garreg Mach and ascended the\nthrone as its first leader. Cyril served as a chamberlain,\nsupervising all general affairs. With the expansion of the\nkingdom, it was eventually decided that the queen would\nmove to a new royal capital. Cyril wished to accompany\nher, but was ordered to enroll in the newly reopened\nOfficers Academy. Though reluctant, he complied. A year\nlater, after consistently demonstrating great wisdom and\nmaturity, he won the queen's heart, and they announced\ntheir abrupt marriage. The move surprised many, but no\none was as shocked as Cyril himself was pleased."
b"\x1bS0 took on the role of archbishop of the\nChurch of Seiros, and Cyril served her in all things, just\nas he had served Rhea. As F\xc3\xb3dlan stabilized, and the\nrebuilding effort came to an end, the Officers Academy\nfinally reopened, and the archbishop directed Cyril to\nenroll there as a student. A year later, after consistently\ndemonstrating great wisdom and maturity, he won the\narchbishop's heart, and they announced their abrupt\nmarriage. The move surprised many, but no one was as\nshocked as Cyril himself was pleased."
b"After finally saving both F\xc3\xb3dlan and Rhea from crisis,\n\x1bS0 ascended the throne as the first leader of\nthe United Kingdom of F\xc3\xb3dlan. From \x1bEK00his\x1bEL00her\x1bEM00 temporary\nresidence at Garreg Mach Monastery, \x1bEK00he\x1bEL00she\x1bEM00 endeavored to\nrestore and develop F\xc3\xb3dlan. Having narrowly escaped\ndeath, Rhea took time to recover her strength before\nreturning to her role as archbishop. Upon her return,\nshe applied herself to rehabilitating the church and\nhelping those who had suffered because of the war.\nThereafter, the two worked closely to forge new policies\nand achieve progress for F\xc3\xb3dlan. The pair's collective work\ncame to be thought of as nothing short of miraculous."
b"As the new Adrestian emperor, Edelgard gave all she had\nto breathe new life into the government of F\xc3\xb3dlan.\nWith tireless work, great sacrifice, and her devoted servant\nHubert by her side, she instituted new class reforms and\nhelped to ensure the people's independence. Hubert was\nalways close at hand, ready to dispose of unsavory burdens\nby any means necessary. In their later years, they passed\nthe fruits of her labor on to Edelgard's successor and\nvanished from the public eye. Though it is said they\nspent the rest of their lives together, it is unlikely they\never gave voice to the true depth of their affections."
b'As the Adrestian emperor, Edelgard appointed Ferdinand\nas her prime minister, and the two devoted themselves to\nruling F\xc3\xb3dlan. Their sharply contrasting views made for\nfrequent and lively debate, but with each enhancing the\nperspective of the other, F\xc3\xb3dlan was better for it. As they\nworked tirelessly to create a better future, they were soon\nbound together by marriage as well. Their children,\nborn to those who had torn down the old social hierarchy,\nwere encouraged to choose their own paths.'
b"As the new Adrestian emperor, Edelgard gave all she had\nto breathe new life into the government of F\xc3\xb3dlan.\nWith tireless work and great sacrifice, she instituted new\nclass reforms to ensure that people could rise on their own\nmerits. During those years, however, there was a period of\ntime in which she simply disappeared. It is said that she\nwent to the research facility of the foremost authority in\nCrests, Linhardt, who had relinquished his rank and title\nto live a life of study. There, after confirming the results\nof Linhardt's experiments, Edelgard was able to enjoy a\nrare break from her busy life. The respite was brief,\nbut they cherished that time for the rest of their lives."
b"Edelgard, the new Adrestian emperor, appointed Caspar\nas her Minister of Military Affairs, and the two devoted\nthemselves to ruling F\xc3\xb3dlan. Caspar quickly developed a\nreputation for recklessness in his duty, but he compensated\nfor it with successes in the field and was given leeway by\nthe emperor as a result. Privately, the couple's relationship\nas husband and wife was more tempestuous. Their spats\nwere frequent, but it is said that Edelgard took pleasure in\nher ability to influence Caspar, and Caspar enjoyed\nreining the emperor in from time to time. It was a strange\nbut happy union."
b"When Bernadetta inherited House Varley from her father,\nshe tried to withdraw from politics and remain within the\nbounds of her territory, but Edelgard, the new Adrestian\nemperor, would not allow it. Instead, she demanded that\nBernadetta counsel her in governing F\xc3\xb3dlan. It is said that\nthe emperor made this choice to keep herself from being\ntoo detached, and that Bernadetta was all too happy to\nprovide a more emotional perspective now and again.\nThe people of Enbarr could always tell when the two were\nmeeting by the sound of Bernadetta's panicked voice\nringing out from the palace."
b"As Edelgard's reign as the Adrestian emperor began,\nEnbarr was restored, and with it, a certain opera house.\nSoon the Mittelfrank Opera Company put together a war\ndrama depicting the journey and sacrifice of the emperor\nand her companions, and the starring role went to none\nother than Dorothea. Edelgard initially forbade the\ncompany from staging it, but was eventually persuaded by\nDorothea's passionate performance to rescind that decree.\nIt is said that the emperor always set aside time to enjoy\nthe opera thereafter."
b"As the new Adrestian emperor, Edelgard gave all she had\nto breathe new life into the government of F\xc3\xb3dlan. To that\nend, Hanneman's research proved invaluable. Seeking to\ndetermine the nature of Crests, and to do away with the\ninequality caused by them, the Father of Crestology\nproduced magical tools that could be used even without\nthe aid of Crests. These were put to eager use by Edelgard,\nwho saw both of their dreams realized. It is not hard to\nimagine that a pair with such similar ideologies and plans\nfor the future would eventually settle into an affectionate\nand fulfilling relationship."
b"As the new Adrestian emperor, Edelgard gave all she had\nto breathe new life into the government of F\xc3\xb3dlan.\nHer first objective was to institute new class reforms and\nensure the people's independence. For that reason,\nshe sought the counsel of Manuela, whose vast array of\ncontacts, talents, and experience proved invaluable.\nShe became essential to Edelgard, and her skill as a\nphysician kept the emperor in good health for many years.\nBoth remained unmarried, and it is said that the two\nbecame extremely close over the years."
b"After the war, Edelgard and Lysithea threw themselves\ninto the fight against those who slither in the dark.\nThe struggle was long and arduous, but not without its\nbenefits. With careful analysis of ancient techniques,\nthey discovered ways to recover the years of life that had\nbeen stolen from them. Afterwards, the new Adrestian\nemperor and Lysithea, her trusted officer, devoted the\nrest of their lives to F\xc3\xb3dlan's rule. For her counsel in\ninstituting class reforms and ensuring the independence of\nthe people, Lysithea came to be known as the Wisdom of\nthe Empire. The pair of talented women ushered F\xc3\xb3dlan\ninto a new age of innovation and prosperity."
b"After his coronation, Dimitri assumed the throne of the\nHoly Kingdom of Faerghus, and his loyal vassal, Dedue,\nremained ever at his side. Among Dimitri's achievements\nwas the reconciliation with Duscur: an extraordinary effort\nthat required extensive negotiations to get past a history of\nbetrayal and oppression. It was a trying task, but Dimitri\nnever once considered giving up. While they behaved as\nlord and vassal in public, it is said that Dimitri and Dedue\nwere more like family in private. When Dimitri finally fell\nto illness, Dedue tended to his liege's deathbed, and then\ntook up a post at his grave for the rest of his days.\nWhen the time came, they were buried beside each other."
b"After his coronation, Dimitri assumed the throne of the\nHoly Kingdom of Faerghus and spent his life ruling justly\nover F\xc3\xb3dlan. At his side every step of the way was his\nright-hand adviser, Duke Felix Fraldarius. Their lifelong\nbond grew so strong over time that, when Dimitri finally\npassed, it is said that Felix's grief was more potent even\nthan the queen's. The stories of their lives were passed\ndown to future generations as chivalric tales that rivaled\nthose of Loog, the King of Lions, and his sworn friend,\nKyphon."
b'After his coronation, Dimitri assumed the throne of the\nHoly Kingdom of Faerghus and took his friend, Mercedes,\nas his queen. Most were shocked by his choice, as she did\nnot come from a distinguished noble line. Still, when the\npeople saw her devotion to healing the damage caused by\nthe war, they decided she was the ideal match for the one\nthey called the Savior King. It is said that the couple led\nbusy but happy lives, and that they never failed to express\ntheir appreciation for one another, no matter the hardship.'
b"After his coronation, Dimitri assumed the throne of the\nHoly Kingdom of Faerghus and spent his life ruling justly\nover F\xc3\xb3dlan. At his side every step of the way was his\nqueen, Annette, whose wisdom provided not only reliable\ncounsel, but a whole assortment of revolutionary policies.\nThe royal couple's sincere approach to governance earned\nthem widespread acclaim, securing their line as a dynasty\nthat lasted for generations to come. Their married life was\nsaid to be full of love and cheer."
b'After his coronation, Dimitri assumed the throne of the\nHoly Kingdom of Faerghus and spent his life ruling justly\nover F\xc3\xb3dlan. At his side every step of the way was Ingrid,\nwho left House Galatea to serve House Blaiddyd as a\nknight. As they worked together to restore the Kingdom,\nthe pair fell in love and were eventually married. But while\nIngrid was happy to play the role of queen, and to support\nher husband in public and in private, she insisted on\ntaking up a weapon and serving on the front lines in battle.'
b'Dimitri assumed the throne of the Holy Kingdom of\nFaerghus and spent his life ruling justly over F\xc3\xb3dlan.\nSeveral years after his coronation, he took Marianne,\nwhom he loved dearly, as his queen. Many of Dimitri\'s\ngreatest achievements can be traced to wisdom provided\nby Marianne, who had received tutelage from her adoptive\nfather, Margrave Edmund. Many years later, when Dimitri\nfell to illness, he clutched his queen\'s hand until the very\nend. The queen\'s journal, uncovered after her passing,\ncontained recounts of their time together. The last words,\npenned with trembling hand, are: "I would not trade our\ntime together or the happiness we knew for anything."'
b'Dimitri assumed the throne of the Holy Kingdom of\nFaerghus and spent his life ruling justly over F\xc3\xb3dlan.\nSome time after his coronation, he took Flayn, who now\nenjoyed a position of prominence in the church, as his\nqueen. Many speculated at first that the marriage was\npolitically motivated, but it is said that over time the love\nthey had for one another became clear to see. Their lives\nwere full of warmth and tranquility. Many years later,\nwhen Dimitri passed, his journals revealed that he had\nkept a meticulous record of all the meals he and his wife\nhad enjoyed together.'
b"Dimitri assumed the throne of the Holy Kingdom of\nFaerghus and spent his life ruling justly over F\xc3\xb3dlan.\nAt his side was the knight, Gustave, who had discarded\nthe name of Gilbert and reaffirmed his oath of fealty to\nthe royal family. After many more years of service,\nin which the trust between them grew and never wavered,\nGustave finally wished to retire. Though he bristled\nslightly at Dimitri's request to look after and tutor the\nyoung prince, it is said that Gustave took on that duty\nwith due patience and solemnity for the remainder of\nhis life."
b'Dimitri assumed the throne of the Holy Kingdom of\nFaerghus and spent his life ruling justly over F\xc3\xb3dlan.\nTwo years after his coronation, he announced his marriage\nto Catherine. The people speculated wildly about how this\nunion came to be. Some said that Dimitri spent two full\nyears wooing her, while others suggested that the matter\nwas resolved by a duel. In any case, the couple worked\ntirelessly to reform the Kingdom, but despite their busy\ndays, it is said that they always found time for sparring,\nand that the clash of steel could be heard throughout the\ncastle at all hours.'
b"Entrusting the future of F\xc3\xb3dlan to his friends, Claude left\nfor Almyra with Annette, whom he intended to marry.\nHe announced this fact to his father, the king of Almyra,\nwho approved of Claude's growth and Annette's wisdom\nand resolved to entrust the monarchy to them. Once he\nbecame king, Claude established a school of sorcery\nwith the intent to use it as a bridge between Almyra and\nF\xc3\xb3dlan. Annette took on a role as headmaster, supporting\nClaude's dream by opening the doors to students from\nevery corner of the world. Relations between Almyra and\nF\xc3\xb3dlan improved drastically as a result."
b"Entrusting the future of F\xc3\xb3dlan to his friends, Claude left\nfor Almyra with Ingrid, whom he intended to marry.\nHe announced this fact to his father, the king of Almyra,\nwho approved of Claude's strength and Ingrid's virtue and\nresolved to entrust the monarchy to them. Even after\nthey ascended the throne, Claude and Ingrid argued\nfrequently. But while the queen chasing the fleeing king\nthrough the palace was a common occurrence, the couple\nmust have loved one another deeply, for they happily\nraised many children together."
b'Claude left F\xc3\xb3dlan, entrusting its future to his friends.\nHe intended to travel to his homeland of Almyra, but his\nlove for Petra instead drew him west, to Brigid. He won\nher affection, and after receiving the blessing of her\ngrandfather, the king of Brigid, the two were wed.\nSome years later, each inherited their respective thrones.\nAs the monarchs of Brigid and Almyra, Petra and Claude\nfostered friendly diplomatic relations between the two\nregions and F\xc3\xb3dlan.'
b"Claude disappeared from F\xc3\xb3dlan after the war, leaving the\nnew head of House Gloucester, Lorenz, to support the\nnew United Kingdom of F\xc3\xb3dlan in his stead. He proposed\nrevolutionary policies to restore the war-torn region at a\nrapid rate. When the rebuilding effort was complete,\nLorenz turned his eye toward diplomacy, seeking to\nestablish treaties of friendship with foreign nations.\nAlmyra was no exception, and when the two parties met\nfor a summit at F\xc3\xb3dlan's Locket, it was none other than\nClaude, the new king of Almyra, who arrived to negotiate.\nSome speculated that this meeting had been Claude's\nscheme all along, but Lorenz and Claude both denied it."
b'Entrusting the future of F\xc3\xb3dlan to his friends, Claude left\nfor Almyra to reclaim his place as heir to the throne.\nWhen he became king, he asked Lysithea to be his queen\nwith a heart full of love, and with the hope of fostering\nfriendly diplomatic relations with F\xc3\xb3dlan. Due to her\nshortened lifespan, Lysithea declined. Claude, unable to\nabandon his love for her, gave up the throne to go on a\nquest for a means to save her. Years later, he appeared\nsuddenly before her, claiming to have found a cure.\nWith her trust and love to guide him, he whisked her\naway, across the sea. It is unknown where they went.'
b"Entrusting the future of F\xc3\xb3dlan to his friends, Claude left\nfor Almyra to reclaim his place as heir to the throne.\nSeveral years later, when he became king, he took initial\nsteps to open trade routes with F\xc3\xb3dlan, and entered into\nnegotiations with Margrave Edmund. During this time,\nhe was reunited with Marianne, who had grown under her\nadoptive father's guidance into a wise and talented woman.\nShe offered him her aid, and as they worked together to\nsecure friendly relations between their respective nations,\nthey fell deeply in love."
b'Entrusting the future of F\xc3\xb3dlan to his friends, Claude left\nfor Almyra to take his place as heir to the throne.\nHis family saw that he had grown strong and allowed\nhim to claim his birthright. When he became king several\nyears later, he made the surprise announcement that he\nwould make Hilda his queen. Having studied with her\nbrother to prepare for this moment, Hilda demonstrated\nan uncanny talent for diplomacy, and greatly contributed\nto establishing friendly relations between F\xc3\xb3dlan and\nAlmyra. The presence of a F\xc3\xb3dlan-born queen for two\nconsecutive generations did much to alter Almyran values.'
b"Leonie returned to Sauin Village to repay her debts and\nmysteriously vanished afterwards. Some years later,\nwhen trade between F\xc3\xb3dlan and Almyra began in earnest,\nthe village received notice that the Almyran king would be\npassing through on his way to Garreg Mach. The village\nrushed to prepare themselves. When the anticipated day\narrived, they were shocked to find Leonie at the king's\nside. She had gone to visit Claude in Almyra, and had\nended up staying to become his queen. Faced with the\nsight of Leonie in the resplendent clothing of a monarch,\nher father and the other villagers could do nothing but\nstand in mute amazement."
b'Entrusting the future of F\xc3\xb3dlan to his friends, Claude left\nfor Almyra to reclaim his place as heir to the throne.\nSeveral years later, when he became king, he took initial\nsteps to open diplomatic relations with F\xc3\xb3dlan, and asked\nGarreg Mach for aid. During this time, he was reunited\nwith Flayn, who had been helping Seteth run the church.\nShe agreed to help, and as they worked together to secure\nfriendly relations between their respective regions,\nthey fell deeply in love. It is said that Seteth never learned\nof their relationship.'
b'After the war, Claude returned home to Almyra and took\nhis place in the royal family. Some years later he became\nking, and during his reign, promoted policies to improve\nrelations with F\xc3\xb3dlan and protect children who had been\norphaned by the war. After he achieved his goals, he left\nthe throne to a family member and left Almyra. During his\ntravels, he encountered Shamir, who had been wandering\nthe world as a mercenary. It is known that they traveled\ntogether from that day forward, but where they journeyed\nto remains a mystery.'
b'Hubert and Ferdinand became the left and right hands of\nEmperor Edelgard, competing constantly with each other\nto see who could be the more helpful. They were\nopposites\xe2\x80\x94the Minister of the Imperial Household,\nmelancholy and merciless, and the prime minister, bright\nand compassionate. Still, they brought out the best in each\nother. As the Empire became orderly and prosperous, the\ntwo came to be known as the nation\'s "Two Jewels," and\nwere remembered fondly for generations to come. Some\nsay their fame made even Emperor Edelgard jealous.'
b'The marriage between Hubert, Minister of the Imperial\nHousehold, and Bernadetta, leader of House Varley,\nwas so surprising to the public that it was much talked\nabout even outside of political circles in the capital.\nBernadetta took the opportunity to survey the far reaches\nof the new Adrestian Empire, and in her absence,\nHubert took well to the management of Varley territory.\nThey proved to be an astonishingly good match,\nworking together to protect F\xc3\xb3dlan from the shadows.\nIt is said that they showed their affection for one another\nby wearing matching embroidered flowers.\n'
b"After the war, the Mittelfrank Opera Company made a\nresurgence, in no small part thanks to the patronage of\nEmperor Edelgard's confidant, Hubert. Dorothea made a\ncomeback as a songstress within the troupe, which traveled\nall over F\xc3\xb3dlan, putting a large share of its profits toward\nrelief efforts. The opera company was warmly welcomed\nby the war-weary people as a source of solace, and became\neven more famous than before. It was not discovered until\nmany years later that the troupe's tour had been a covert\noperation, coordinated by Hubert and Dorothea to gather\nintelligence for the Empire."
b'Shortly after the war, Brigid renegotiated its diplomatic\narrangement with the Adrestian Empire, ending its service\nas a vassal and becoming a full ally. As part of that\nagreement, Petra, queen of Brigid, was wed to Hubert,\nMarquis Vestra. Some say that the marriage was purely\npolitical, ordered by Emperor Edelgard, while others insist\nthat it was of their own accord. Although they led busy\nlives, and sometimes lived separately. Still, their shared\nhome in the western F\xc3\xb3dlan village of Nuvelle was filled\nwith their many children, suggesting a loving union.'
b'As confidant to Edelgard, Hubert disposed of every burden\nfacing his emperor by any means necessary, and excelled\nat working in the shadows. Supporting him from the front\nlines was the former mercenary, Shamir, who commanded\nthe emperor\'s elite troops. When the two married, they\nappeared from the outside to be little more than a lord of\nthe Empire and his dutiful wife. In reality, their nights\nwere filled with fierce combat against rebels, assassins, and\nthose who slither in the dark. It is reported that one of\nthem was known to often state that, "To find love between\nlife and death is a gift." It is unknown which of the two\nactually spoke these words.'
b"After the war, Mercedes traveled to Fhirdiad to pay a visit\nto her adoptive father. Though she introduced Ferdinand,\nshe left out the small detail that they were engaged to be\nwed. Married in secret, Ferdinand and Mercedes worked\ntogether to reform the new Duke Aegir's territory, and\nthe effort was so successful that Emperor Edelgard named\nFerdinand her prime minister. It was a busy life for him\nindeed, but as he was known to say to his government\ncolleagues, coming home to a smiling family made all the\nhard work worth it."

b"After the war, Bernadetta renounced her claim to House\nVarley. She married Ferdinand, the new Duke Aegir, and\nthe two contributed to relief efforts by instituting reforms\nacross their Dukedom. Due to the success of those\npolicies, Ferdinand was offered the position of prime\nminister by the emperor. He accepted, leaving the\nmanagement of Aegir territory to his wife, while he\nworked to apply their ideas to the Empire at large. Since\nBernadetta did not like to leave home, Ferdinand's life\ninvolved a lot of travel to and from the capital, but it is\nsaid he always embarked on his return home with a smile\non his face."

Since Bernadetta did not\nlike to leave home, Ferdinand's life involved a lot of travel,\nbut it is said he always embarked on his return home with\na smile."
b"After officially becoming the new Duke Aegir, Ferdinand\nset about reforming his territory. Thanks to the wisdom of\nhis wife, Dorothea, Ferdinand's policies were of massive\nbenefit to the commonfolk and brought about a swift\nrecovery. In recognition of this achievement, he was called\nupon by Emperor Edelgard to introduce these reforms to\nthe Empire at large as the new prime minister. Though the\nwork kept him very busy, he always managed to find time\nfor Dorothea. It is said that their children filled their\nloving household with beautiful music ever after."

Though the work\nof reforming the entire nation kept him very busy, he\nalways managed to find time for Dorothea. It is said that\ntheir children filled their loving household with beautiful\nmusic ever after."
b"After officially becoming Duke Aegir, Ferdinand asked\nEmperor Edelgard if she would make him her minister of\nforeign affairs rather than her prime minister. She granted\nhis wish, and his first task in his new position was to\nnegotiate with Petra, who had inherited the throne of\nBrigid and declared her Kingdom's freedom from Imperial\nvassalage. Ferdinand and Petra collaborated to deepen the\nfriendship between their nations and forge a strong,\nenduring alliance. As a symbol of the nations' friendship,\nFerdinand and Petra took up residence together in\nNuvelle, on the western fringe of F\xc3\xb3dlan. It is said that\nthey negotiated for years to achieve this compromise."
b'After officially becoming Duke Aegir, Ferdinand worked\nto restore the territory, and as part of that effort, sought to\ndevelop an improved relationship with Brigid. He reached\nout to Petra, who had inherited the throne of Brigid, and\nshe agreed to send resources for the relief effort. At the\nsame time, the two continued their private relationship\nacross borders, and when Aegir territory had recovered,\nthey married. Ferdinand relocated to Brigid with his\nqueen, and the pair worked tirelessly to improve\ndiplomatic relations. Their work involved much travel,\nbut they made sure to find time once in a while to stop\nand enjoy their happiness.'
b"Ferdinand announced his engagement to Marianne just\nafter becoming the new Duke Aegir. While he got started\nrestoring his territory, Marianne returned home to study\npolitics under her shrewd adoptive father. When she\nreturned to Ferdinand's side, they were wed, and with\nher new skills she proved herself to be an asset to the\nrebuilding effort. Aegir territory flourished under their\nreign, becoming one of the most prosperous regions in all\nF\xc3\xb3dlan. It is said that Ferdinand commissioned a bronze\nstatue of his wife to honor her, but that Marianne ordered\nit to be hidden away in storage for eternity."
b"Ferdinand announced his marriage to Marianne just\nafter becoming the new Duke Aegir. With the support of\nMargrave Edmund, they set to work restoring Aegir\nterritory. The support of Marianne's adoptive father was\nessential, but not sufficient, for the relief effort. As more\ndifficulties arose, Marianne herself took on an increasing\namount of responsibility. She proved quite capable and\ndedicated, and the Dukedom progressed through a steady\nrecovery under the couple's collective efforts. It is said that\nFerdinand commissioned a bronze statue of his wife to\nhonor her achievements, but Marianne ordered it to be\nhidden away in storage for eternity."
b'After becoming the new Duke Aegir, Ferdinand married\nHilda, the daughter of Duke Goneril. The marriage was\nwarmly received by the people, with high expectations\nplaced on them as they set about restoring the territory.\nHilda rarely took part in politics herself, but she still\ncontributed greatly by recommending exceptional people\nto influential positions. Her hobby of creating fashionable\naccessories also bore fruit, as her designs achieved\nwidespread popularity, and she created the first artisan\nacademy in F\xc3\xb3dlan. The school produced many talented\ncraftsmen, including Ferdinand himself, who was said to\ncraft handmade trinkets for his wife.'
b'Ferdinand married Flayn just after becoming the new\nDuke Aegir, and the pair wasted no time getting to work\non the rebuilding effort. While Ferdinand handled\nadministrative matters, Flayn walked more directly among\nthe people, seeing to their needs. Their teamwork and\ncomplementary skills led to rapid recovery and growth for\nthe region, but it is said that what inspired the people most\nof all was the genuine intimacy and affection between the\nruling couple.'
b"Almost immediately after becoming the new Duke Aegir,\nFerdinand married Manuela, and the two dedicated\nthemselves to reformation efforts. Manuela lent her\nconsiderable talent and experience, using personal\nconnections she'd gained in her time as a songstress and\nteacher to assemble a team of talented people. Between her\npersonal skills and her ability as a physician, she became\nso essential that the emperor saw fit to make her the new\nprime minister. As she spent more time in the capital,\nbringing the reforms that helped Aegir territory to the\nEmpire at large, Ferdinand stayed behind, minding his\nown lands and looking after their child."

b'When the Officers Academy reopened after the war,\nLinhardt gave up his inheritance to take on a position as a\nprofessor there. He soon married Annette, who had taken\non the same job, and side by side, they helped to educate\nthe next generation of students. Unfortunately, Annette\ntook her teaching duties far more seriously than Linhardt,\nwho was more concerned with his Crest research, and\ndeveloped a reputation for falling asleep\xe2\x80\x94sometimes more\nthan once\xe2\x80\x94during his own lectures. In their first few years\nas a couple she fought desperately to correct his behavior,\nbut later she learned to accept it, and even looked forward\nto finding creative ways to wake him up.'
b'After the war, Linhardt and Caspar abandoned their\nnoble houses to pursue a carefree journey wandering the\nworld. They traveled to every corner of F\xc3\xb3dlan, and even\nventured abroad now and again. Caspar got into trouble at\nevery turn on their travels, but Linhardt was always there,\nbegrudgingly, to get him out of it. The records of their\nadventures were immortalized in a book by an anonymous\nauthor, entitled "The Thousand Roads and Seven Seas."\nIt is said they did eventually settle down, after the events\nin those stories, but where they actually went is unknown.'
b"Linhardt and Bernadetta caused quite the stir after the\nwar when they abandoned their inherited titles and\neloped to Garreg Mach. Returning to the monastery,\nwhere they were always most comfortable, the couple lived\npeaceful lives away from the hassle of politics. When the\nEmpire's efforts to restore the church were complete, the\nOfficers Academy reopened, and two eccentric individuals\ntook up professorships there. One was perpetually asleep,\nor absorbed in absentminded study; the other refused to\nshow herself at all unless it was time to give a lecture."

b'After the war, Linhardt decided to inherit his title. He\nspent several years studying his territory, learning to\nmanage its affairs, and when he was finally ready to\nbecome the new Count Hevring, he announced his\nmarriage to Dorothea. Somehow, despite all this activity,\nLinhardt actually managed to keep up with his Crest\nstudies. Though his results were dubious at times, his new\nwife helped him alter them so that they would be of use to\npeople. Their relationship was unlike anything the\nnobility had ever witnessed. When faced with this\naccusation, Linhardt and Dorothea could only laugh and\nnote that the past was of no significance to them.'
b"Petra returned to her homeland of Brigid, and inherited\nthe throne from her grandfather. As ruler, she declared\nindependence from F\xc3\xb3dlan, and renegotiated Brigid's\ndiplomatic relationships on more equal terms. Next, she\nintroduced industrial practices that were modeled on those\nof F\xc3\xb3dlan, vastly improving her homeland's economy. This\nrapid development surprised those abroad, until it was\ndiscovered that the improvements came thanks to the\ncounsel of Petra's husband, Linhardt, who had left F\xc3\xb3dlan\nto offer Brigid his talent and insight. It is said that the\ncouple maintained a healthy and affectionate relationship,\nand that they raised many happy children together."
b"Though Linhardt researched vigorously for a method by\nwhich to remove the Crests from Lysithea and save her\nlife, the war ended before he could reach any conclusions.\nLysithea, deciding that she should return home to her\nparents, thanked Linhardt and took her leave of Garreg\nMach. Not to be deterred, Linhardt set his affairs in order,\nrenounced his noble title, and followed Lysithea to\nOrdelia territory to continue his research. Years later, his\nefforts bore fruit, and Lysithea's Crests were successfully\nremoved. With a new future ahead of her, Lysithea, too,\nrenounced her noble claim, and the couple married as\ncommoners. It is said they raised a very happy family."
b"Marianne returned home to a warm welcome from her\nadoptive father, who recognized her wisdom and skill and\nbegan to groom her as his successor. Meanwhile, Linhardt\nabandoned his noble claim, and happened to choose\nMargrave Edmund's territory as the site at which to\ncontinue his Crest research. Edmund took a liking to\nLinhardt and approved wholeheartedly when the scholar\nand his daughter expressed their wish to marry. As\nEdmund's successors, the couple combined Linhardt's\nbrilliance with Marianne's practical wisdom to bring\nabundance to the people."
b'Immediately after the war, Flayn disappeared from Garreg\nMach. At the same time, Linhardt mysteriously abandoned\nhis claim to House Hevring, and also vanished. It was\nsuspected, among those who knew them, that they had\neloped, although no one seemed to know just where they\nwent. Over a decade later, well after the Officers Academy\nhad been rebuilt, something strange happened. A sleepy\nyoung girl with antiquated clothing and the Major Crest\nof Cethleann enrolled. Over the next two years, a young\nboy and girl with that same Crest also enrolled. Though\nCrest scholars deduced that they must be siblings,\nthe truth of their lineage was never definitely proven.'
b"When Rhea absconded her post as archbishop, Catherine\nresigned from the Knights of Seiros and accompanied her\nto a life of seclusion in the Red Canyon. They were joined\nby Catherine's new husband, Linhardt, who continued his\nCrest research at Catherine's behest. Motivated by his\nwife, and freed from all other distractions, Linhardt made\nnew discoveries at an astonishing rate. The fruits of his\nresearch brought about dramatic changes in the world of\nCrest research, but for the sake of his privacy, Linhardt\nalways published his papers anonymously."
b"Catherine left the Knights of Seiros and set out to travel\nacross F\xc3\xb3dlan. With Thunderbrand in hand, she wandered\nthe countryside, seeking always to defend the innocent and\npunish the wicked. During these years of heroics, she had\nan unusual traveling companion in Linhardt, who had\nrenounced his noble title and followed her. During their\nadventures, Catherine was said to be nearly unstoppable,\nand Linhardt all but useless\xe2\x80\x94except in moments of great\nneed, when the Crest scholar's wisdom would suddenly\ncarry the day. The pair's adventures lived on as beloved\nfolktales, passed down through the generations. It is\nunclear whether the two were ever romantically involved."
b"After the war, Caspar and Ashe embarked on a carefree\njourney around the world. They traveled to every corner\nof F\xc3\xb3dlan, and even ventured abroad now and again, with\nthe sole purpose of punishing those who preyed upon the\nhelpless. Though Caspar seemed to get into trouble at\nevery turn, Ashe was always there to get him out of it, and\nCaspar's bravery and strength returned the favor more\nthan once. Though opposites in many ways, they shared\nthe same view of justice, and their abilities complemented\none another nicely. The stories of their adventures lived on\nas exciting and amusing folktales."
b"In recognition of his achievements during the war, Caspar\nwas given the title of Minister of Military Affairs in the\nnew Adrestian Empire. Though he was well-known for his\nvalor in battle, it was his wife, Annette, who reined in his\nrecklessness and who truly kept the army in order. The\ntroops came to see Annette as a motherly figure, and under\nher guidance, the Imperial army thrived. In their private\nlife as a couple, the roles were totally reversed, as Caspar\nhad to be the one to step in and correct Annette's various\ncalamities around the house."
b"Annette returned to her hometown of Fhirdiad, where she\ntook up a teaching position at the school of sorcery and\nmentored many great sages. Unfortunately, she remained\nprone to accidents, and one such event nearly took her life.\nSeparated from her students in the mountains, she became\ntotally lost\xe2\x80\x94but just when it seemed she would never be\nfound, she was rescued by none other than Caspar, who\nhappened to be passing through on his travels around the\nworld. After this lucky reunion, he escorted her to\nFhirdiad, and during his time there, the two fell in love.\nThe couple's fateful tale inspired a generation of young,\nstarry-eyed students."
b'After some uncertainty about the details, it was decided\nthat Caspar would marry into Bernadetta\'s family, seeing\nas she had claim to House Varley. The two had a chaotic\nreign, and a marriage to match. Each time Caspar caused\nsome incident, Bernadetta would demand promises as\nrecompense. Over time, these oaths accumulated to such a\ngreat number that it became necessary to compile them,\nand the resulting document came to be known as the "47\nArticles of Bernie." Among these Articles was the provision\nthat, when counting their large quantity of children,\nCaspar was not to accidentally count his wife among them.'
b'In recognition of his achievements during the war, Caspar\nwas given the title of Minister of Military Affairs in the\nnew Adrestian Empire. Though his command developed a\nreputation for occasional recklessness, he proved an able\nleader, guiding his troops to overcome countless obstacles.\nIn his personal life, he began to spend a great deal of time\nwith Dorothea, who had returned to the Mittelfrank\nOpera Company after the war. When her efforts brought\nthe opera house to the peak of its resurgence, it is said that\nDorothea relinquished her position as songstress in order\nto retire with Caspar. They are rumored to have spent the\nrest of their lives together.'
b"After the war, Caspar set out alone on a journey of\nself-discovery. He traveled to every corner of F\xc3\xb3dlan, and\neven ventured abroad now and again. Though his antics\nfound him no end of exciting adventures, he was always\ndrawn back to Dorothea, who had returned to the\nMittelfrank Opera Company in Enbarr after the war. The\ntwo spent more and more time together over the years,\nand when Dorothea's efforts brought the opera house to\nthe peak of its resurgence, she relinquished her position as\nsongstress and disappeared from the stage. It is rumored\nthat the pair spent the rest of their lives together."
b"Petra returned to her homeland of Brigid, and inherited\nthe throne from her grandfather. As ruler, she declared\nindependence from F\xc3\xb3dlan, and renegotiated Brigid's\ndiplomatic ties to F\xc3\xb3dlan and Dagda on more equal terms.\nAt every step along the way, she was accompanied and\nsupported by her husband, Caspar, who had left F\xc3\xb3dlan\nbehind to be with her. It is said that the people of Brigid\nwere initially suspicious of the union, due to Caspar's\nrelation to a nemesis of their homeland, but that his\ntireless efforts on Brigid's behalf endeared them to him\nover time. It certainly helped that he made the queen\nvery happy."
b"Caspar and Hilda, under no pressure to inherit any noble\ntitles, spent the early years of peace after the war traveling.\nThey journeyed to every corner of F\xc3\xb3dlan, and even\nventured abroad now and again. Caspar's antics caused\nendless entertainment for Hilda, who loved to stand by\nand watch him fight or squirm his way out of trouble.\nEventually, their free-spirited adventure was called to an\nend by Hilda's brother, Holst, who offered Caspar a\nposition as a knight in service of House Goneril. Caspar\naccepted, and before long, he and Hilda were married.\nThe couple raised many children, and were said to have a\nnotoriously lively household."
b"When Rhea absconded her post as archbishop, Catherine\nresigned from the Knights of Seiros and followed in order\nto protect her. They were joined by Catherine's new\nhusband, Caspar, who had the same goal, and together\nthey retired to a life of seclusion in the Red Canyon.\nCaspar and Catherine spent the bulk of their days farming\nand hunting, but since neither was content to go a day\nwithout wielding a weapon, they sparred routinely.\nThe sound of their swords ringing out, in time with\nCaspar's heated cries, was heard daily across the valley."
b'Catherine resigned from the Knights of Seiros and traveled\nacross F\xc3\xb3dlan with Caspar. They dedicated themselves to\ndefending the helpless wherever they went, and in time,\nthe names Thunder Catherine and Inferno Caspar were\nknown to all the world. Legends of their adventures\nbecame so popular and well-known that even catchphrases\nsuch as "Face the wrath of Thunderbrand!" and "Hey,\nthat\'s not your sword!" were recounted in the stories that\nwere passed down for generations.'
b"After the war, Caspar and Shamir used their clout as\nheroes to establish a mercenary company. They branded\nthemselves as crusaders for justice, punishing those who\npreyed on the weak or exploited others for their own gain.\nNone could compete against their combined martial skill,\nand they became famous all throughout F\xc3\xb3dlan. Their\ntravels took them to every part of the world, and while\nCaspar's antics occasionally got him into trouble, Shamir's\nsteady presence and firm demeanor helped to resolve\nmatters amicably. Their stories endured as amusing\nanecdotes, passed down through generations."
b"After the war, Felix inherited the title of Duke Fraldarius\nfrom his late father, Rodrigue. He married Bernadetta,\nwho abandoned claim to House Varley in order to start a\nlife with him. After they had finished restoring Fraldarius\nterritory, Felix traveled across F\xc3\xb3dlan as the king's right\nhand. While he was away, Bernadetta handled local affairs\nwhile holed up in her room in the castle. The frigid air of\nnorthern Faerghus caused her to hide away even more\nthan usual, but whenever her beloved husband returned,\nshe would rush out to greet him."
b'After the war, Felix attempted to set out on his own, but\nwas waylaid by Bernadetta, who begged him not to go.\nPersuaded to stay, Felix ended up marrying into House\nVarley, the title of which Bernadetta had inherited. The\ncouple got along smoothly, although it was rumored that\nin the early years of their marriage, she once had to\nrestrain him physically to prevent him taking a trip to the\nOghma Mountains to train. As the years wore on,\nBernadetta became more reclusive, and Felix took over\nmany of the day-to-day duties of running the house.\nDocuments from their later years were increasingly signed\nwith the name Felix, Count Varley.'
b'When Bernadetta first inherited control of House Varley,\nshe hid away and would not dare involve herself in\npolitical or administrative affairs. During this time it\nwas Raphael who came to her aid, encouraging her to\nwork through her fear of people. The training period was\ndifficult\xe2\x80\x94"humiliating," according to the journals\nBernadetta left behind\xe2\x80\x94but in the end, it had its desired\neffect. The leader of House Varley became an outgoing\nand authoritative individual, taking part in public policy.\nShe even took on a very muscular husband.'
b'After the war, Seteth remained at the monastery and\ndedicated himself to the restoration of the church. He was\nsoon joined by Bernadetta, who abandoned her inheritance\nto House Varley and took up residence at Garreg Mach to\ncommit to a life as a recluse. As the years wore on, Seteth\nwrote many fables, first in his spare time, and then later as\nhis main preoccupation. His stories became famous among\nchildren throughout F\xc3\xb3dlan. As he gained renown, many\nbegan to inquire about the wonderful illustrations that\naccompanied the writing. In response to these questions,\nSeteth was known to shrug and say, "Ask my wife...if you\ncan find her."'
b"After the war, Felix inherited the title of Duke Fraldarius\nfrom his late father, Rodrigue. He married Dorothea,\nand the two began a happy life together. After they had\nfinished restoring Fraldarius territory, Felix traveled across\nF\xc3\xb3dlan as the king's right hand. Dorothea traveled with\nhim always, and even threw herself into battle alongside\nhim every so often. Tales of their bravery endured for\ngenerations, thanks in no small part to the operas that\nDorothea wrote and composed herself."
b"Even after the war's end, skirmishes continued to break\nout across F\xc3\xb3dlan. Learning that there were still places\nwhere he could fight, Felix abandoned his noble title and\nchose to make a living with his sword. He traveled the\nland, and some years later found himself in Enbarr. There\nhe encountered Dorothea, who had just resumed her\ncareer as a songstress in the opera. From that time on,\nno matter how far Felix traveled, he always found himself\ndrawn back to that opera house. It is said that, when\nDorothea saw his face in the crowd, she sang only for him."
b"After more than 10 proposals, Dorothea finally relented\nand agreed to marry Sylvain. Together they inherited\nGautier territory. With the support of his wife's counsel,\nthe new Margrave Gautier was able to improve relations\nwith the Sreng people, and thereby convince the local\nnobles that Relics and Crests were no longer an absolute\nrequirement for survival. Due to their efforts, they went\ndown in history as an extraordinary lord and lady.\nIt is said that what finally convinced Dorothea to marry\nSylvain was his promise that they would grow old happily\ntogether, and that he was true to his word."
b"Petra returned to her homeland of Brigid, and inherited\nthe throne from her grandfather. As ruler, she declared\nindependence from F\xc3\xb3dlan, and renegotiated Brigid's\ndiplomatic ties to that nation on more equal terms. At\nevery step along the way, she was accompanied by\nDorothea, who had left F\xc3\xb3dlan behind to support her.\nDorothea used the connections she had made in her time\nat the opera to her benefit, and even worked reluctantly\nwith the F\xc3\xb3dlan nobility for Petra's sake. The people of\nBrigid were skeptical of her at first, but warmed up to\nher over time. It is said that she became the person whom\nPetra loved the most."
b'As the new head of House Gloucester, Lorenz first worked\nto restore his own territory, and then expanded his vision\nto include reforms for all F\xc3\xb3dlan. At the height of his\nstoried political career, he announced his marriage to\nDorothea, who had returned to prominence with the\nMittelfrank Opera Company. The elaborate wedding was\nthe most talked-about social event of the season, and the\nfashions on display from the savvy nobleman and the\nstylish songstress set the trends with young people across\nF\xc3\xb3dlan for a decade.'
b"Though F\xc3\xb3dlan had changed, Hanneman's goal remained\nunwavering: to determine the workings of the Crests, and\nto do away with the inequality caused by them. To that\nend, his research resulted in magical tools which could be\nused even without the aid of Crests. This proved to be yet\nanother worthwhile discovery by the Father of Crestology.\nHanneman also became a father in more literal sense, by\nraising many children with his wife, Dorothea. Their\nmarriage was not publicly known, however, as the\nsongstress elected to keep it secret for the sake of both of\ntheir careers."
b'The Mittelfrank Opera Company was on the brink of\ncollapse until two of its star songstresses, Manuela and\nDorothea, returned to the stage and brought the troupe\nnew life and prominence. They toured all around F\xc3\xb3dlan,\nsometimes even visiting troops on the front lines, soothing\nhearts with their beautiful songs wherever they went, and\ndonating their profits to the relief and rebuilding effort.\nWhen the damage from the war had finally healed, the\npair once again retreated from the stage, this time retiring\nto a private life together. It is said that their relationship\nwas full of light and love.'
b"Petra took Ashe with her to her homeland of Brigid, where\nshe inherited the throne from her grandfather. With Ashe's\nguidance, she established an order of knights, and used\nthat order to declare independence from F\xc3\xb3dlan and\nrenegotiate diplomatic ties on more equal terms. Over\nyears of work reforming diplomatic and military policy\ntogether, Petra and Ashe fell in love and eventually were\nmarried. The people of Brigid warmly embraced the\nunion. It is said that the name of the knightly order, the\nBlue Sun, was born of their mutual love of swimming in\nthe sea."
b"Petra returned to her homeland of Brigid, and inherited\nthe throne from her grandfather. As ruler, she declared\nindependence from F\xc3\xb3dlan, and renegotiated Brigid's\ndiplomatic ties to F\xc3\xb3dlan and Dagda on more equal terms.\nAt every step along the way, she was accompanied and\nsupported by her husband, Ignatz, who had left F\xc3\xb3dlan\nbehind to be with her. Trade with F\xc3\xb3dlan boomed under\nPetra's reign, thanks in no small part to the Victor Trading\nCompany. But while Ignatz was happy to support Petra's\ngoals, he remained focused on his work as an artist. His\npicturesque renditions of the Brigid landscape, done in the\nF\xc3\xb3dlan style, were held in high regard all over the world."
b"Petra returned to her homeland of Brigid, and inherited\nthe throne from her grandfather. As ruler, she declared\nindependence from F\xc3\xb3dlan, and renegotiated Brigid's\ndiplomatic ties on more equal terms. Some years later, the\nChurch of Seiros expanded its reach to Nuvelle, a town in\nwestern F\xc3\xb3dlan. The priest sent to this new church, for the\npurpose of keeping up relations with Brigid, was none\nother than Cyril. He and Petra met frequently, first for\npublic relations, and then for more private reasons. They\nfell in love, and were ultimately wed. It is said that their\nunion served as a symbol for the friendly ties between the\ntwo countries for the whole of their lives."
b"Though the innocence of the Duscur people was proven,\nprejudice against them still lingered in the Kingdom\ncapital. For this reason, Ashe refused a knighthood when it\nwas offered to him, and chose instead to open an inn that\nspecialized in Duscur cuisine. Dedue began to frequent\nthe place on breaks from his duty as the king's vassal, and\nover time, imparted to Ashe his culinary wisdom. As the\ninn gained popularity, the people of the Kingdom began\nfinally to see the Duscur people in a positive light. This\nled to a reconciliation between the two cultures that came\nrather more quickly than expected."
b'Two years after the war, Dedue and his wife, Mercedes,\nopened a school in the Duscur residential district in\nFhirdiad. The school educated Duscur children, who had\nnever been given structured learning before, in reading,\nwriting, arithmetic, and even Duscur history. Many years\nlater, when the Duscur people reclaimed their homeland,\nthe people who attended this school were able to resettle\nthere and revive their old culture. Because of this, Dedue\nand Mercedes were forever renowned by the Duscur.'
b"Some time after the war, Dedue and Annette exchanged\nwedding vows in a modest ceremony and then settled\ndown to a life in Fhirdiad. For them, life after marriage\nstayed much the same as before. Dedue continued his duty\nto King Dimitri, and Annette took up a teaching position\nat Fhirdiad's school of sorcery. Though each gave the\nother space for the work that was important to them, they\nmade sure to spend much of their free time together, and\nto bond over the cooking and housework."
b'After the war, Dedue and Ingrid both served as protectors\nto the newly crowned King Dimitri: the former as his loyal\nvassal, and the latter as a knight sworn to House Blaiddyd.\nThe pair fought side by side on countless occasions, and\nwere known to be inseparable on the battlefield. Tales of\nthe taciturn vassal and the steadfast lady knight were\ntold by bards all throughout F\xc3\xb3dlan, and it is said that\ntheir friendship helped spark the reconciliation between\nthe peoples of Faerghus and Duscur.'
b"After the war, Dedue returned to Fhirdiad to support\nKing Dimitri's reign as his vassal. As he worked, his wife,\nFlayn, was determined to support him with home-cooked\nmeals. Dedue patiently endured the more disastrous of his\nwife's experiments, while teaching her everything he knew.\nEventually Flayn's talent blossomed and she became\na renowned chef. It is said that those who were lucky\nenough to taste her cooking always asked for more, and\nthat Dedue's eyes lit up with affection and pride when she\ntold him what she was planning to prepare next."
b"After the war, Dedue returned to Fhirdiad to support\nKing Dimitri's reign as his vassal. Shamir was ever near,\nand as Dedue's trusted partner and a mercenary for the\nroyal family, she complemented his public-facing work\nwith by handling any necessary covert operations. The\ntrusting professional relationship between the two\nblossomed into love, and soon they were married. It is said\nthat, when absolutely no one else was around, they would\nlet down their guard and engage in secret jokes and\nidle chatter."
b'After the war, Felix and Sylvain inherited their respective\ntitles of Duke Fraldarius and Margrave Gautier, and set to\nwork restoring the Kingdom. Each led a busy life, but that\nonly seemed to enhance their friendship over the years.\nEach became known for making surprise visits to the estate\nof the other, in order to deliver the latest taunting in a\nfriendly but relentless game of one-upmanship. It is said\nthat, in their later years, they became so close that they\npassed away on the same day, as if conceding that one\ncould not live without the other.'
b"Even after the war's end, skirmishes continued to break\nout across F\xc3\xb3dlan. Learning that there were still places\nwhere he could fight, Felix abandoned his noble title and\nchose to make a living with his sword. Decades later, he\nreunited briefly with Sylvain, who had need of his services\nas Margrave Gautier. Felix departed as soon as the job was\nfinished, however, and the two never met again. Years\nlater, a sword that was thought to have belonged to Felix\narrived on Sylvain's doorstep."
b"After the war, Felix inherited the title of Duke Fraldarius\nfrom his late father, Rodrigue. A year later he married\nMercedes, who helped complete the rebuilding effort by\npaying special attention to children who had lost their\nfamilies during the war. When their efforts were complete,\nthey settled into a busy life together, with Felix serving as\nthe king's trusted retainer, and Mercedes supporting him\nin all things. It is said that every so often, the pair would\nventure out of their territory in order to visit a graveyard\nfor fallen Imperial soldiers. There, they left flowers on a\nmysterious, unmarked grave, and prayed for the one who\nrested there."

She had begun a new life as a cleric in service to\nthe goddess, and with her kindness and generosity, she was\nable to turn his life around. No one knows what became of\nthem after that, but the tales of a swordsman who made\nwarriors across F\xc3\xb3dlan tremble with fear all come to an\nend at that point."
b'After the war, Felix inherited the title of Duke Fraldarius\nfrom his late father, Rodrigue. Some time later, he married\nAnnette, and the pair earned renown together by working\nhard at restoring their territory to and beyond its former\nglory. The people adored the pair: Felix for his fierce\ndetermination, and Annette for her boundless cheer. Years\nlater, Annette threw herself into songwriting, and with the\nsupport and encouragement of her husband, she produced\nmelodies that remained popular for generations. The lyrics\nbecame distorted over time, however, and the original\nmeaning of the music was lost.'
b'After the war, Felix intended to abandon his noble title\nand make a living with his sword. On the day that he was\nto depart, however, he was waylaid by Annette, who\nbegged him not to leave her behind. Instead, she proposed\nthat they relocate to the Officers Academy when it\nreopened, and take up positions as teachers. When the\nschool did reopen, it is said that the new sword instructor\nwas notoriously harsh, but that he eventually learned to\nenjoy his work. He was seen to smile, on occasion, but\nonly in the presence of the friendly professor of sorcery.'
b"After the war, Felix inherited the title of Duke Fraldarius\nfrom his late father, Rodrigue. He married Ingrid, the\ndaughter of Count Galatea, and the couple spared no\nexpense in restoring both their territories, paying special\nattention to Galatea's desperate need for food and funds.\nSome years later, there was an attack on the castle town,\nand the duke lost the use of his sword arm from an injury\nsustained protecting his wife. It is said that he never\nregretted it, as he was only fulfilling a promise that he\nmade to his beloved wife a long time ago."
b"Even after the war's end, skirmishes continued to break\nout across F\xc3\xb3dlan. Learning that there were still places\nwhere he could fight, Felix abandoned his noble title and\nchose to make a living with his sword. Unwilling to leave\nhim to travel alone, Ingrid, too, relinquished her claim to\nnobility, and they both became wandering mercenaries.\nThey skirted the line between life and death countless\ntimes in their dangerous work, but once they had a child,\nthey settled down in a small farming village far from their\nhomeland. With all but each other left behind, they began\na warm and tranquil life as a family."
b"After becoming Duke Fraldarius, Felix married Lysithea,\nwho assisted his efforts to restore both his territory and the\nKingdom at large with countless insights. She became\nknown for walking among the people, sharing with them\nher wisdom. After her death, Felix received a visit from a\nlocal artisan, who brought to him a cake and claimed that\nLysithea had given him the recipe. Felix adored the flavor,\nenjoying that style of cake for the rest of his days. The\npeople acquired a taste for it too, and Lysithea's treat\nbecame traditional in the north of Faerghus."
b"After the war, Felix abandoned his noble title and chose to\nmake a living with his sword. He traveled the land, seeking\nbattle as if he had a death wish, but his violent path came\nto an end when he happened upon Lysithea, who had been\nliving in a small house in the middle of nowhere with her\nparents. Seeing her\xe2\x80\x94condemned to live a shortened life,\nbut smiling and making the most of every day with her\nfamily\xe2\x80\x94convinced Felix that life was precious. He gave up\nhis sword to join her, and the two spent their lives baking\nsweets. Lysithea's recipe became known far and wide, and\nthe treat became a tradition for the people of that region."
b"Leonie took over the mercenary group formerly led by\nJeralt. She made a name for herself as a superb mercenary\nand was eventually hired by the young Duke Fraldarius,\nFelix. He entrusted her with many important tasks, and\nover time, Fraldarius territory became Leonie's home base.\nThe two spent a great deal of time drinking together, but\nFelix, knowing Leonie's reputation and habits, learned to\nextract her payment for the drinks in advance."
b'After the war, Felix abandoned his noble title and chose to\nmake a living with his sword. He accepted Leonie as his\npartner, and together they became wandering mercenaries.\nTheir different fighting styles complemented one another\nwell, and their combined skill was enough to handle any\nenemy. Some time later, the mercenary group formerly led\nby Jeralt joined them, and under their leadership, became\nthe most feared company in F\xc3\xb3dlan. After the post-war\nchaos passed, however, work became scarce, and the pair\neventually became so desperate that they rebranded\nthemselves as street performers. They proved surprisingly\ncapable in their new profession.'
b"After becoming Duke Fraldarius, Felix married Flayn,\nand the couple worked tirelessly to restore their territory.\nThanks to Felix's dedication and Flayn's compassion, they\nwere well loved by the people, whom they visited and\nspoke with frequently. Felix served as Dimitri's sworn\nsword throughout his reign, but when the king passed\naway, he gave it up in favor of a quiet life with his wife.\nIn his later years, the sword was only used for parlor tricks,\nsuch as slicing juggled fruit out of the air\xe2\x80\x94a display of\nskill that never failed to delight Flayn."

It was there that he reunited with Flayn, who was\nsaddened to see that Felix had continued to use his sword\nto kill. She left to travel with him, and it is rumored that\nher kindness helped turn his life around. No one knows\nwhat became of them after that, but the tales of a deadly\nswordsman did suddenly cease."
b"After the war, Ashe was formally knighted and appointed\nthe new head of House Gaspard, which had no successors.\nThe young and inexperienced lord faced a great deal of\ndifficulty in governing. Though he was famously tenacious\nand never lost heart, it was perhaps only due to the\nconstant counsel of his wife, Mercedes, that he managed to\novercome all obstacles. When not busy governing their\nterritory, the couple lifted one another's spirits by baking\ndelicious sweets for each other. The tradition was so\nheartwarming that it became popular for husbands and\nwives in that region to do the same for generations."
b"After the war, Ashe was formally knighted and appointed\nthe new head of House Gaspard, which had no successors.\nHe married Annette, and the couple's combined tenacity,\nintelligence, and courage proved more than a match for\nthe many difficulties they faced in governing.

b'When the new king was crowned in Faerghus, both Ashe\nand Ingrid left their homes to travel to Fhirdiad and\npledge themselves to the royal family as knights. They\neach swore to defend the king, come what may, no matter\nthe cost, and to that end they fought side by side in many\nbattles together. They were both praised for their endless\ndevotion and boundless courage, and their names went\ndown in history as peerless knights. Many tales were told\nof their valor, and how they became indispensable to each\nother over the years. A handful of those stories went so far\nas to suggest that they fell in love and became husband and\nwife, but this may have been an embellishment.'
b"When Galatea territory was seized, Ingrid argued strongly\nfor the preservation of its borders. Her request was\ngranted and she was appointed to rule, but because she\nhad previously abandoned her noble house, she was not\nwell accepted by the people at first. It was thanks to the\nhelp of Ashe, who arrived to serve House Galatea, that she\nwas able to soften the view the people had toward her by\nrestoring the territory and improving its agriculture. As\nGalatea's prosperity grew, so too did the love between\nIngrid and Ashe. Their wedding ceremony was intended to\nbe a simple one, but lavish blessings from the citizenry\nmade it a lively event."
b"After the war, Ashe was formally knighted, and appointed\nthe new head of House Gaspard, which had no successors.\nThe young and inexperienced lord faced a great deal of\ndifficulty in governing, until his court was blessed with\na new adviser in Marianne.

As the prosperity of Gaspard territory grew, so\ndid a love between them, and soon Margrave Edmund saw\nfit to bless the couple's happy marriage. Years later, Ashe\nasked Marianne what made her choose to help him in the\nfirst place. She simply smiled and said that she decided to\nmake supporting him her dream."
b"When Rhea resigned her position of archbishop and left\nthe Church of Seiros, Catherine followed, and the pair\nbegan a life of seclusion in the Red Canyon. Years later,\nthey began to hear rumors of a wise young man who had\nbeen knighted and appointed lord of House Gaspard.\nSoon they were approached by that lord, Ashe, who came\nto the Red Canyon to kneel before Catherine and ask her\nto be his wife. With Rhea's encouragement, Catherine was\npersuaded to accept. She left the Red Canyon with him,\nand the two began their journey together."
b"After the war, Ashe was formally knighted and appointed\nthe new head of House Gaspard, which had no successors.\nHe asked Catherine, who had left the Knights of Seiros, to\nmarry him, but she declined, convinced that the people of\nGaspard territory would never accept it. Refusing to set\nhis love for Catherine aside, Ashe worked diligently along\nwith the Church of Seiros to expose the full truth of the\nWestern Church's plot. With great persistence, he\nconvinced the people of this truth, and then persuaded\nCatherine finally to reconsider. The people received her\nreluctantly at first, but over time, they recognized her\nvirtue and came to accept her."
b'After the war, Ashe was formally knighted and appointed\nthe new head of House Gaspard, which had no successors.\nThe young and inexperienced lord faced a great deal of\ndifficulty in governing, until his court was blessed with\na new adviser in Cyril.

The pair swore always to be\nthere to help one another, and remained best friends for\nthe whole of their lives.'
b"As Margrave Gautier, Sylvain devoted his life to improving\nrelations with the people of Sreng. Under his leadership,\nnobles were persuaded that Relics and Crests were not\nnecessary as they'd previously thought. Though he went\ndown in history as an extraordinary lord, he could not\nhave done so without the constant support and counsel of\nhis wife, Mercedes, whose wisdom and guidance brought\nprosperity to the people. The couple built a loving home\nlife, surrounded by happy children, and when Sylvain at\nlast passed away, he was succeeded by his oldest child, who\nbore no Crest."

b'After the war, Annette and Mercedes lived separate lives:\nthe former as a teacher at the school of sorcery in Fhirdiad,\nthe latter as a cleric at Garreg Mach. Though they lived\napart, they exchanged letters so frequently and shared\ntheir lives with one another in such detail that it was as\nthough they were side by side. After many decades, they\nresigned their respective positions and reunited at Garreg\nMach. In their final years, they relocated to a modest\nhouse in the Fortress City. It is said that they were happy\ntogether to the very end.'
b"After the war, Mercedes accompanied Lorenz back to his\nhomeland. There, the young heir petitioned his father,\nCount Gloucester, to permit the couple to marry. Though\nthe count initially disapproved of Mercedes's status as a\ncommoner, he was persuaded by her virtues as a person to\nchange his mind. In fact, he praised Lorenz for having a\ntaste in character superior to his own. After Lorenz\nsucceeded his father as lord of the territory, the couple\nfinally wed. With Lorenz's stern approach to governance,\nand Mercedes's open mind, House Gloucester flourished\nunder their rule."
b'Mercedes left home and opened a small orphanage in the\nFaerghus region with her mother.

b"Mercedes left home for a life as a cleric at Garreg Mach.\nAlois, as Jeralt's successor, officially assumed the role of\ncaptain of the Knights of Seiros. Though the two were\nquite busy with their daily activities, they would often find\ntime to get together in the evenings so Alois could hear\nMercedes's ghost stories. No one can say for certain\nwhether it was the constant exposure to spooky tales or\nsome other cause, but from that time on, Alois's reputation\nbecame that of a totally fearless fighter. Mercedes's quiet\nsupport was widely credited for this increase in bravery.\nHer blessing came to be known as a guarantee of victory."

There,\nwhile educating the next generation of mages, they made\ngreat strides in their research of Crests and magic.\nWorking side by side, the pair\xe2\x80\x94formerly teacher and\nstudent, now partners and colleagues\xe2\x80\x94brought great\nprogress to the world and prestige to their institution. It is\nsaid that the wait list for students to enroll in either of\ntheir classes was notoriously long."
b"Gustave discarded the name of Gilbert and reaffirmed his\noath of fealty to King Dimitri and the royal family. After\nreturning to Fhirdiad, he reunited with his wife, who had\nreturned to live with Baron Dominic, and his beloved\ndaughter, Annette, who had begun teaching at the capital's\nschool of sorcery. Though it was initially an awkward\nreunion, over time the family rekindled their love for one\nanother. As the shadow of war receded from the Kingdom,\nthe three spent their days happily making up for lost time."
b'Raphael returned to his home town to serve his liege lord\nas a knight, and spent his spare time helping out at the inn\nthat his grandfather and sister had opened during his time\naway. One day, Ingrid, who had abandoned her claim to\nHouse Galatea to serve as a knight to the royal family,\narrived to persuade Raphael to join her. It did not take\nmuch convincing. From that day forward, they served\ntogether as partners, fighting together side by side to make\ntheir mark on the history of Faerghus.'
b"When Galatea territory was seized, Ingrid argued strongly\nfor the preservation of its borders. Her request was\ngranted, and she was appointed to rule. Soon after,\nRaphael traveled there to pledge his service to Ingrid. He\ninitially signed on as a knight, but quickly discovered that\nhis services were even more desperately needed by the\nland's farmers, and instead focused his efforts on helping\nGalatea improve its agriculture.

They held a modest but lively wedding, and the\npeople happily gave their blessing to the union."

b'Leonie took over the mercenary company formerly led by\nJeralt. She ran out of money constantly, however, due to\nsending all of her earnings back to her village, and so\ndeveloped a reputation for unpaid tavern tabs. When she\ncame upon the inn that Raphael had been helping to run\nwith his family, she was overjoyed to finally find a place\nthat would trust her enough to open a new tab. In her\nyears frequenting the establishment, she accrued such a\nmassive debt to Raphael that the only way to pay him off\nwas to work for him. By the time the debt was finally paid,\nshe had moved in with him. They lived together happily\nfor the rest of their days.'

While shopping for art\nsupplies, she had a chance reunion with Ignatz, who had\npersuaded his family to allow him to travel the world as\nan artist. Hilda invited Ignatz to teach at her school,\nand as she and the students became enchanted by the\nlandscapes and portraits of all he had seen in his travels,\nthe two gradually fell in love. Their romance birthed a\nnew style that inspired artists in F\xc3\xb3dlan for generations.'
b'Leonie took over the mercenary company formerly led by\nJeralt. Though she earned a great deal of renown, the\nwork began to dry up as the postwar chaos subsided. It was\naround that time she had a chance reunion with Ignatz,\nwho had persuaded his family to allow him to wander the\nworld as an artist. Remembering how they had once\npromised to travel together, Leonie disbanded her\nmercenary company and resolved to accompany him.\nThe pair left F\xc3\xb3dlan, searching for sights hitherto unseen.\nWhere their journey took them remains unknown.'
b"Soon after the war, Flayn disappeared. Ignatz searched\nunsuccessfully for her for a time, but finally gave up and\nwent home. With hard-won permission from his family, he\nthen set out to travel the world as an artist. Years later, his\njourney took him by chance to Garreg Mach, where the\nstatue of Saint Cethleann inspired him to paint. It was\nthen that Flayn finally appeared, wondering aloud why\nIgnatz was not painting her as he'd promised. Overjoyed,\nIgnatz devoted much of the rest of his artistic career to\ngetting Flayn's likeness just right. Her visage was finally\ncaptured in the work he called The Second Advent of a\nSaint, which was widely regarded as a masterpiece."
b'Soon after the war, Shamir disappeared. Ignatz searched\nunsuccessfully for her for a time, but finally gave up and\nwent home. With hard-won permission from his family, he\nthen set out to travel the world as an artist. Years later, he\nencountered Shamir by chance at an inn. When she saw\nthat Ignatz had not yet left F\xc3\xb3dlan, she encouraged him to\nleave the region, and offered to stay at his side and guard\nhim until he did. It is rumored that he was overjoyed by\nthis offer, and that the pair soon departed F\xc3\xb3dlan to the\nwest by sea, but where they traveled after that is unknown.'
b'After the war, Lysithea returned to her parents in Ordelia\nterritory. She was joined by Hanneman, and together the\ntwo worked to research a method by which to extend her\nlifespan. Some years later, their efforts bore fruit, and they\ndevised a procedure to remove her Crests. Afterward,\nLysithea renounced her noble claim and continued to\nassist Hanneman with his research. When he passed, she\ntook up his mantle, and by the great discoveries she made,\ncame to be called the Golden Child of Crestology.'
b"Lysithea returned home to help her parents restore their\nfamily land. Years later, when their work was at an end,\nshe journeyed to Garreg Mach to inform the church of her\ndecision to relinquish House Ordelia's claim to nobility.\nThere she encountered Cyril, who had since graduated\nfrom the Officers Academy and joined the Knights of\nSeiros. During their reunion, Cyril confessed his love to\nLysithea and asked her to marry him. She declined, at first,\ndue to her shortened lifespan, but in the face of Cyril's\ninsistence, she chose to spend what days she had remaining\ntogether with him. Where they went is unknown, but it is\nsaid that, for however long it lasted, they were happy."
b'After returning to their respective homes, Hilda and\nMarianne stayed in touch and deepened their friendship\nthrough letters. Hilda informed Marianne that her passion\nfor crafting fashionable accessories had given her the idea\nto start an artisan academy, and in response, Marianne\npledged the financial support of the house of Margrave\nEdmund. Soon, artisan schools began to appear all over\nF\xc3\xb3dlan, producing talented craftsmen and high-quality\ntrade goods, which contributed greatly to the prosperity\nof F\xc3\xb3dlan. The accessories sent to Marianne personally by\nHilda became some of the most highly valued treasures\nin history.'
b"After the war, Marianne and Hanneman stayed in touch\nand deepened their friendship through letters. When\nHanneman's Crest research fell on hard times, Marianne\nwas able to secure Margrave Edmund's financial support to\nallow his work to continue. The research bore fruit in the\nform of magical tools which could be used even without\nthe aid of Crests, and the funding allowed these tools to be\nproduced in great number. After Marianne inherited her\nadoptive father's house, she guided Hanneman to create a\nbranch of research devoted to peaceful applications of\nCrestology. These advancements, which Hanneman\nprovided, became the legacy of Marianne's later years."
b"After the war, Seteth dedicated himself to the restoration\nof the church. He continued to write fables for children in\nhis spare time, but became dissatisfied with the hobby\ndue to a lack of quality illustrations for his work. When\nHilda learned of this, she jumped at the chance to visit\nGarreg Mach and illustrate some of Seteth's newer stories\nfor him. The completed fables were distributed far and\nwide, and the children who loved them eventually passed\nthe famous and beloved works on to their own children\nand grandchildren."
b"Hilda returned to her territory, and founded the first\nartisan academy in F\xc3\xb3dlan. Years later, as the successful\nheadmaster of that school, she journeyed to Garreg Mach\nto make a donation to the church. There she encountered\nCyril, who had graduated from the Officers Academy and\njoined the Knights of Seiros. When each saw how much\nthe other had grown and matured, a mutual attraction\nbetween them blossomed naturally into love. Cyril\neventually left the church to become a knight of House\nGoneril, at the invitation of Hilda's brother, Holst.\nAs Holst's new brother-in-law, Cyril provided essential aid\nin negotiations with House Goneril's Almyran neighbors."
b'While Seteth remained at the monastery after the war to\nrestore the Church of Seiros, Leonie wandered the land in\npursuit of her dream to become an elite mercenary. It\nseemed as if their paths would never cross again. Years\nlater, after they had achieved their goals, both retired and\ndisappeared from the public eye at the same time, as if it\nhad been prearranged. Though no official records of their\nlives after that time exist, it is rumored that a happy couple\nresembling them was sighted in a small mountain village.\nThe couple was known for their excellent fishing skills,\nand for cooking up their bountiful catches for all the local\nvillagers and travelers.'
b"Leonie joined up with the mercenaries formerly led by\nJeralt. As his greatest apprentice, she quickly took on a\nleadership role, and eventually even inherited the title of\nBlade Breaker. No matter where she went, however, she\nwas burdened with Jeralt's unpaid tavern tabs. Angry with\nAlois for pushing these debts upon her, she went to see\nhim with the intention of forcing him to pay half the debt.\nBut when she arrived, she found a suntanned Alois happily\nlounging after a hard day's work on his family farm. Leonie\nfound herself unable to go through with it. She did become\na world-renowned mercenary, but she spent the whole\nof her career paying off debt."

She encountered a\nsmiling Alois, who had become captain of the Knights of\nSeiros, and who was all too happy in his new prosperity to\ntake the debts back on. It is said that Leonie developed\nquite the drinking habit once she was free to visit taverns\nwhenever she liked."
b"Leonie assumed leadership of the mercenaries formerly led\nby Jeralt. One day, she was hired to protect a noble who\nhad been warned of a bandit attack. The warning note\nlisted all of the noble's foul deeds, and was signed with the\nimage of a spider, which Leonie recognized. Just as she\nsuspected, the one who came on the appointed day was\nnone other than Shamir. Leonie was happy to break her\ncontract on this occasion, and even offered Shamir a\nposition in her company. The result was the most famous\nmercenary group ever to exist in F\xc3\xb3dlan. It is said that \ntheir flag bore the image of a spider, and...another vaguely\narachnid creature."
b'While Flayn disappeared soon after the war, Seteth stayed\nat the monastery and worked to restore the authority of\nthe Church of Seiros. Doing away with his old strictness,\nhe adopted a tolerant stance toward all, and encouraged\nhis followers to do the same. When he was satisfied that\nthe message was received, he vanished from the monastery.\nSeveral centuries later, a man and a woman in ancient\nattire emerged to a F\xc3\xb3dlan that had drastically changed.\nWhen she asked the man beside her if it would be all right\nin this new era to call him "Father," he said that perhaps it\nwould be better to remain on the safe side.'
b"After the war, Seteth remained at the monastery to rebuild\nthe church. Several years of hard restorative work later, he\nreceived a letter from Manuela. She wrote that she had\ntraveled to a small, war-torn town and opened up a school\nfor children. Reminded of the beauty and compassion in\nManuela's heart, Seteth was moved to leave the monastery\nand join her there. As they worked together to manage the\nbudding institution, the couple fell in love and eventually\nwere married. It is said that their students were overjoyed."
b"After the war, Seteth fully confessed his love to Catherine\nand asked her to marry him. Intending to accompany Rhea\nto a life of seclusion, however, Catherine declined. Over\nthe years, as Seteth worked to rebuild the church from the\nmonastery, he continued to write love letters to Catherine.\nWhen the rebuilding effort was complete, he journeyed to\nthe Red Canyon, where she and Rhea had been living, and\ndelivered all of his letters by hand. Catherine was deeply\nmoved, and with Rhea's blessing and no more reason to\nrefuse him, she accepted his proposal. The two were wed\nand lived out their lives happily alongside Rhea."
b'After the war, Seteth fully confessed his love to Catherine\nand asked her to marry him. Refusing to remain at the\nmonastery, however, Catherine declined. Over the years,\nas Seteth worked to rebuild the church, he continued to\nwrite love letters to Catherine. Her answer was always the\nsame. Finally, when the rebuilding effort was complete,\nSeteth left the church and went to see her, declaring his\nlove anew. With no more reason to refuse him, she at last\naccepted his proposal. The two were wed, and swore to\nwalk side by side together through the new age.'
b'After the war, Hanneman and Manuela held a grand\nwedding ceremony, to which all of their many students\nwere invited. Later, after the church was transformed and\nrehabilitated under the supervision of the Empire, the\nOfficers Academy finally reopened, with a renewed focus\non accepting students regardless of status and offering\nclasses on a wider variety of practical subjects. Hanneman\nand Manuela returned to work as teachers, almost as if\nnothing had changed, and filled the halls with their banter\nin the way only married couples can.'

Manuela\nand Hanneman returned to work as teachers, almost as if\nnothing had changed, and filled the halls with their banter\nin the way only married couples can. Their relationship\nspawned a trend of romances among colleagues at the\nOfficers Academy, but that is an entirely different story.'
b'Alois officially took up the title of captain of the Knights\nof Seiros. In this new role, he led the knights to many\nvictories, and was much beloved. At the same time, he\ndeveloped a reputation for gullibility, and his subordinates\nbegan to play tricks on him regularly. To help him deal\nwith this, Catherine volunteered her services as an adviser.\nShe kept a lookout for him, and put a stop to these antics\nbefore they began. The combination of the kindly captain\nand the intimidating wielder of Thunderbrand proved\nstrong, and the Knights of Seiros prospered.'
b"After quitting the Knights of Seiros, Catherine and Shamir\nset out on a lifelong journey together. The pair were\ninseparable as they traveled across F\xc3\xb3dlan, and eventually\nwound up in Shamir's homeland of Dagda. They faced\nmany hardships on their adventures, some of which were\nself-inflicted, as the duo had a way of sticking their noses\ninto others' business in their efforts to right wrongs. It is\nsaid, however, that no foe they encountered ever proved\na match for the combined might of Shamir's marksmanship\nand Catherine's Thunderbrand."
b"Shortly after the war, Shamir and Cyril disappeared from\nthe ranks. The Knights of Seiros searched unsuccessfully\nfor them for some time, but finally resigned themselves to\nthe loss. Though the pair was never officially heard from\nagain, rumors swirled persistently for years of two master\narchers turned thieves. Initially the knights received\ncomplaints and investigated, but when it was discovered\nthat the pair only lined their pockets by shaking down\nthose who preyed upon the innocent, they decided it was\nnot an investigation worth pursuing. The thieves' story\nbecame a folktale beloved by the people."
b'Ingrid declined to rule House Galatea, choosing instead\nto serve House Blaiddyd as a knight. Some years later, she\nwas reunited by chance with Ignatz, who had persuaded\nhis family that he should become a painter and traveled all\nthrough F\xc3\xb3dlan painting beautiful landscapes. Ignatz\ndecided to paint Ingrid that day, and spent much of the\nrest of his career working to get her likeness just right.\nThere were many depictions of her bravery in battle, of\ncourse, but later generations would most fondly remember\nthe way he captured her smile, which was widely believed\nto be that of a loving wife.'
b'When Galatea territory was seized, Ingrid argued strongly\nfor the preservation of its borders. Her request was\ngranted, and she was appointed to rule, but because she\nhad previously abandoned her noble house, she was not\nwell accepted by the people. It was thanks to Ignatz that\nthe mood of the people finally softened. He showed them,\nthrough his artwork, a side of Ingrid that they had not yet\nseen: her valor and bravery, fighting in defense of F\xc3\xb3dlan.\nThe people were moved, first by the artwork itself, and\nlater by the woman who had inspired it. As time passed,\nand the region prospered, Ingrid and Ignatz bonded over\ntheir reunion. They fell in love and eventually were wed.'
b'After the war, Annette and Mercedes lived separate lives:\nthe former as a teacher at the school of sorcery in Fhirdiad,\nthe latter as the proprietor of an orphanage in a village in\nthe Faerghus region. Though they lived apart, they\nexchanged letters so frequently and shared their lives with\none another in such detail that it was as though they were\nside by side. After many decades, Annette decided to\nresign from her post and move to the village where\nMercedes lived to help run the orphanage. The life they\nlived there was modest, but it is said that they were happy\nto the very end.'
b'After the war for F\xc3\xb3dlan, Jeritza threw himself fully into\nthe struggle against those who slither in the dark. Visage\nmasked by the likeness of death itself, he laid waste to his\nenemies with a scythe that terrified friend and foe alike.\nWhen it was all over, he stole away in secret and vanished\nwithout a trace. His whereabouts thereafter have been the\nsubject of much conjecture.'
b"Anna's business savvy proved to be a great asset in the\npost-war reconstruction of Garreg Mach. Once the\nrestoration was complete, she disappeared from the area\nentirely, though tales of a mysterious merchant were\npassed down in every corner of the world for centuries\nto come. Some say she continues her travels even to this\nday, eternally peddling her wares, and ever in search of\nthe next lucrative opportunity."
b"After the war for F\xc3\xb3dlan, \x1bS0 and Jeritza\nthrew themselves fully into Emperor Edelgard's struggle\nagainst those who slither in the dark. Though the battle\nproved vicious, none could stand against the combined\nmight of shining sword and reaper's scythe, and the pair\nbecome venerated by history as heroes of Adrestia. Once\nthose who slither in the dark were forever vanquished,\nthe two heroes stole away in secret and vanished without\na trace. Their whereabouts thereafter have been the\nsubject of much conjecture among historians."
b'Once those who slither in the dark were finally defeated,\nMercedes left home and opened a small orphanage in\nthe Faerghus region with her mother. After many years\nof kind service raising children who had lost their families,\nshe received a letter bearing familiar handwriting.\nIts author, a prisoner in Enbarr, expressed his sincerest\nwell-wishes to Mercedes and her family. Still more time\npassed until, one day, the man who wrote the letter paid\nher a visit. With joyful tears in her eyes, Mercedes smiled,\ntook Emile by the hand, and at last welcomed him home.'
b"Entrusting the future of F\xc3\xb3dlan to his friends, Claude left\nfor Almyra to reclaim his place as heir to the throne.\nSeveral years later, when he became king, he took initial\nsteps to open diplomatic relations with F\xc3\xb3dlan, and asked\nGarreg Mach for aid. Alongside him was his wife, Flayn,\nwho had gone missing during the war, but who now\nworked tirelessly to bridge the gap between their two\nlands for the sake of the late Seteth. It is said that\nsome churchgoers disapproved of this new stance toward\nAlmyra at first, but that Flayn's love for Claude proved\nto be a key inspiration in shifting the perspectives of\nthe populace."
b'After F\xc3\xb3dlan had healed from the war, Yuri\'s organization\nspent the next few decades cultivating and controlling\nillicit markets. Not coincidentally, wherever Yuri\'s\nunderground businesses thrived, so too did orphanages\nand almshouses. For the awe and respect his generosity\nearned him among the downtrodden, Yuri came to be\nknown as the "Underground Lord."'
b"Balthus disappeared shortly after the war, but rumors\nof his exploits swirled for a long time thereafter. Some\nsay he returned to Kupala, where he became a protector\nof the mountain folk. Others say he remained right under\nGarreg Mach's nose as a prominent underworld figure.\nWhatever the truth, the tale of his domination in the first-\never All-F\xc3\xb3dlan Tournament Brawl is likely too persistent\nto be a fabrication."
b'After the war for F\xc3\xb3dlan, Balthus whole-heartedly joined\nthe battle against those who slither in the dark. The\ndevastation he wrought in the Battle of Shambhala was\nimmortalized in a tapestry, entitled "Avatar of War," and\npassed down through the generations. Afterward, it is said\nhe returned to Kupala and became a protector of the\nmountain folk.'
b'For her service in war, and her innovations in magic,\nConstance von Nuvelle was among the first to receive\npeerage in the new F\xc3\xb3dlan. For generations thereafter,\nher noble house was valued as a leader in magical\nresearch and development.'
b'For her service in war, and her innovations in magic,\nConstance von Nuvelle was among the first to receive\npeerage from Emperor Edelgard. Though her noble\nhouse was given no guarantee of power on a hereditary\nbasis, Constance made certain that House Nuvelle would\nbe valued as a leader in magical research and development\nfor generations to come.'
b'Where exactly Hapi went after the war is unknown. Some\nsay she returned to her hometown to live a quiet life,\nwhile others speculate she assumed a new identity in the\nunderworld beneath Garreg Mach. There is one incident\nthat is a matter of historical record, however. Some years\nlater, remnants of those who slither in the dark emerged to\nthreaten F\xc3\xb3dlan once again. They were defeated by a\nmysterious woman leading a horde of beasts.'

b"Though Hapi's exact whereabouts after the war for F\xc3\xb3dlan\nare not known, it is widely speculated that she returned to\nher hometown to live a quiet life.

b'As the new leader of the United Kingdom of F\xc3\xb3dlan,\n\x1bS0 worked tirelessly to reform and rebuild\nin the aftermath of a devastating war. Constantly at his\nside during that time was his husband, Yuri, whose policy\nproposals led, time and again, to better education and\nopportunities for the less fortunate. After working to\nensure a bright and prosperous future for F\xc3\xb3dlan, the\ncouple stepped back from the public eye and vanished\nfrom official record. Curiously, informal notes and letters\nfrom friends suggest that the pair was extraordinarily\nlong-lived and that their youth was untouched by the\npassage of time.'

b'No sooner was the modest wedding ceremony between\n\x1bS0 and Yuri over than the battle with those\nwho slither in the dark began in earnest. Through the\nbloody and brutal fight, the couple became known for\ntheir constant determination to save every possible life,\nleaving none behind.

b'After ascending to the throne as the first leader of the\nUnited Kingdom of F\xc3\xb3dlan, \x1bS0 announced\nher marriage to Balthus. The people were reluctant to\naccept this union at first, considering his reputation, but\nhis natural charisma in speeches and his ability to exceed\nexpectations eventually won their blessing. Though mostly\nnoted for his strength and dedication as a bodyguard,\nBalthus also provided counsel. It is said that many civil\nand diplomatic reforms owe their origins to his advice.'

b"Almost as soon as \x1bS0 and Balthus finished\ntheir lively wedding celebration, the battle with those who\nslither in the dark began in earnest. Leading from the front\nlines, the couple drove the enemy back again and again,\ncausing such carnage on the battlefield that even their\nImperial allies and subordinates were intimidated. After\nhostilities came to an end, their names faded from official\nhistorical records but persisted in folk tales. Of the stories\nthat spread to every corner of F\xc3\xb3dlan and survive to this\nday, the most prominent one features criminals who\nthreaten to abduct a traveler's wife. The traveler laughs\nand wishes them the best of luck."
b'After ascending to the throne as the first leader of the\nUnited Kingdom of F\xc3\xb3dlan, \x1bS0 announced\nhis marriage to Constance, who was given peerage for her\nservice in war and permitted to revive House Nuvelle. \nPraised for her innovative talent, she rapidly rose to\nprominence in the new era, and her house came to be\nrelied upon as a valued leader in magical research and\ndevelopment for generations. She was not without her\ndetractors, however.

b"Almost as soon as \x1bS0 and Constance were\nwed in a spectacular ceremony, the battle with those who\nslither in the dark began in earnest. Constance's efforts to\nunderstand and implement the magical techniques of the\nenemy quickly became instrumental, both to the fight and\nto the era of peaceful Imperial rule that followed.

b"After ascending to the throne as the first leader of the\nUnited Kingdom of F\xc3\xb3dlan, \x1bS0 announced\nhis marriage to Hapi. Her disquieting lineage earned her\nmore than her fair share of detractors, but over time, as\nthe royal couple restored F\xc3\xb3dlan together, the people\ncame to appreciate her competence and taciturn wit.\nSome years later, when those who slither in the dark\nemerged to threaten F\xc3\xb3dlan once again, it is said that\nHapi's strength was instrumental in dealing with them."

b'Almost immediately after \x1bS0 and Hapi had\ncelebrated their marriage in a lively ceremony, the battle\nagainst those who slither in the dark began in earnest.\nContrary to expectations, Hapi wholeheartedly charged to\nthe front lines and fought alongside her husband until true\npeace came to F\xc3\xb3dlan. Afterward, the couple vanished\nwithout a trace\xe2\x80\x94at least until someone claiming to be a\ndescendant produced a chronicle of their lives. According\nto that account, the pair had retired to a secluded village\nat the foot of the Oghma Mountains.

b'After the war for F\xc3\xb3dlan, Jeritza threw himself fully into\nthe struggle against those who slither in the dark. Visage\nmasked by the likeness of death itself, he laid waste to his\nenemies with a scythe that terrified friend and foe alike.\nWhen it was all over, he stole away in secret and vanished.\nAt the same time, a mysterious guest arrived in Varley\nterritory, which Bernadetta had inherited from her father.\nOn that day, the reclusive noble and her guest were seen\nwalking the grounds pleasantly together. A rendition of\nthat scene, said to be painted by Bernadetta herself,\nremains at the estate to this day.'
b'After the war, Jeritza and Constance joined the battle\nagainst those who slither in the dark. In that dire\nstruggle, which raged across the continent, Constance\nearned her noble title with powerful magic that proved\nessential to victory. Her rise in status ruffled more than a\nfew feathers, but Jeritza kept the Imperial nobility in line.\nIt is said, in the ballads composed about the couple, that\nthey swore their wedding vows in the beautiful rose garden\nthey had planted together on the Nuvelle estate.'
b"After the war, Yuri returned to the underworld. Some time\nafter assuming control of the illicit markets, he happened\nupon Balthus, who had become so down on his luck that\nhe had collapsed in an alley. Yuri helped Balthus back\nto his feet and offered him work as a bodyguard. While\nBalthus first accepted just to get by, he came to enjoy\nthe lifestyle so much that he remained at Yuri's side for\nthe rest of his days. The underworld kingpin and the\nIndomitable King of Grappling made such an impression\non the world that their names were feared for centuries."
b'After the war, Constance devoted herself to her magical\nresearch. Her unorthodox methods allowed her to make\ngreat strides, which earned her acclaim and eventually\nenabled her to restore her noble house. Afterward, almost\nas if to spite her detractors, she married Yuri. The pair\nmade a happy, if unconventional, couple, as the husband\nfrequently ventured away for months on end. In the long\nyears of their marriage, however, Constance laughed off\nany concerns\xe2\x80\x94she was known to say that Yuri always\nknew how to find his way home. Many decades later,\nhe passed away in bed alongside his beloved wife.'
b'After the war, Yuri accompanied Hapi to the village where\nshe was born. The surprise nature of the visit, combined\nwith a local custom of massive celebrations for family\nreunions, made things awkward at first. The party did not\nget started until nightfall, but Hapi was able to reunite\nwith her parents, and under that starry sky, lasting bonds\nwere forged. In fact, it is said that Yuri, a complete\nstranger, made such an impression that the welcome party\nlasted for seven days and nights before he was finally\npermitted to leave. Years later, they returned for another\nvisit\xe2\x80\x94this time as a couple. The village turned out en\nmasse for the wedding, held under those same stars.'
b"Bernadetta's struggle with anxiety made it difficult for her\nto take over as the head of House Varley. She became so\noverwhelmed that when Yuri chanced to visit her domain,\nshe literally grabbed hold of him and refused to let go.\nBaffling as it was for Yuri at the time, this peculiar state of\naffairs eventually led to marriage. The commonfolk were\ninitially perplexed, but over the years they became grateful\nfor Count Varley's surprising husband. His presence kept\nher calm and allowed her to deal with her people more\nfrequently and easily. As a result, her talent for governance\nblossomed and her rule was widely celebrated."
b'A new opera company was born of the postwar rebuilding\nperiod. This troupe, headed up by a former songstress,\nwas comprised of hand-picked talent from all walks of life.\nThough it began humbly, over the years it grew to rival\neven the Mittelfrank Opera Company in its greatness.\nThe most popular production in its repertoire was a tale\nof a disillusioned songstress making a comeback with the\nhelp of her ambitious lover. Through that story, the names\nof Yuri and Dorothea live on to this very day.'
b"Yuri disappeared into the underworld of the western\nKingdom and faded away into obscurity. The only account\nof him after that comes from a Kingdom knight's journal,\nuncovered many decades later, which tells of Yuri's efforts\nto win the king's support for an orphanage and medical\nclinic to be built in the slums of the castle town. It is\nbelieved that the journal belonged to Ingrid, who had\ndeclined to rule House Galatea in order to serve House\nBlaiddyd as a knight. According to local rumor, Ingrid\neventually retired from knighthood to become the owner\nof an inn. There, it is said that she and the man she wrote\nabout cooked dishes loved by rich and poor alike."
b'For her service in war, and her innovations in magic,\nConstance von Nuvelle was among the first to receive\npeerage in the new F\xc3\xb3dlan. The very next day, she and\nBalthus were wed, and the couple set about the restoration\nof House Nuvelle. For their domain, they claimed not the\nland once ruled by that house, but rather an area in the\neast of Leicester that encompassed Kupala. There, they\nbecame known as advocates for the mountain folk, and as\nnobles who lived moment to moment as outlandishly\nas they pleased.'
b'After the war, Balthus and Constance joined the battle\nagainst those who slither in the dark. The devastation they\nwrought in Shambhala was immortalized in a tapestry,\nentitled "Avatars of War," which preserved their legacy\nfor generations. Afterward, the two were married.\nConstance was among the first to receive peerage from\nEmperor Edelgard, and though Balthus sometimes chafed\nfrom being at the mercy of his wife\'s whims, the couple\nworked diligently to solidify the new social order under\nImperial rule. House Nuvelle was given no guarantee of\ncontinued power on a hereditary basis but nevertheless\nachieved lasting status as a leader in the magical arts.'
b'Shortly after the war, Hapi and Balthus disappeared. Their\nabsence from the world stage was not lasting, however, as\nbefore long they emerged as the leaders of an elite band of\nmercenaries. The group traveled all over F\xc3\xb3dlan helping\nthose in need, with a noted specialty in handling monsters.\nIt is said that these mercenaries lived raucously, laughing\noften, and that not a single sigh of discontent was ever\nheard. Some years later, when those who slither in the\ndark returned to threaten F\xc3\xb3dlan once again, these\nmercenaries were instrumental in dealing with them.'

b"Perhaps unexpectedly, Balthus accompanied Claude upon\nhis return to his homeland of Almyra. While Claude\nassumed the role of a politically active prince, Balthus\nspent his days drinking, flirting, and brawling. As soon as\nClaude inherited the throne, however, all that changed.\nIn the blink of an eye, Balthus became son-in-law to the\ngreat commander, Nader, and took up a position of\nmilitary command in service to Claude's stated goal to\nimprove relations with F\xc3\xb3dlan. To foster trust, Claude\nfrequently sent Balthus into F\xc3\xb3dlan on missions to help\nquell revolts begun by Imperial loyalists."
b"Most of Balthus's debts vanished in the chaos after the\nwar, and those few that remained were paid off with what\nhe had earned in the fighting. Free to do as he pleased,\nhe sought out Hilda, and the two of them went on an\nadventure around the world. Crossing F\xc3\xb3dlan's Throat,\nthey journeyed through and beyond Almyra, where they\nare said to have found a kingdom of gold in the far east.\nThough the details of their adventure are largely lost, one\nanecdote firmly remains. To win Holst's blessing to take\nhis sister out of F\xc3\xb3dlan, Balthus had to beat him in a duel."
b"Balthus accompanied Lysithea home to help her parents\nrestore their family land, securing the aid of his younger\nbrother, who happened to be lord of a nearby domain.\nYears later, when the end to their hard work was finally in\nsight, Lysithea relinquished House Ordelia's claim to\nnobility, ceding the territory to a nearby lord. Shortly\nthereafter, Balthus brought her and her family to Kupala,\nin F\xc3\xb3dlan's Throat. There, they fell in love and lived\npeaceful, happy lives blending in with the mountain folk."
b'Once all the fighting was over, Hapi and Constance set\nout together on a journey across F\xc3\xb3dlan. They toured the\nland as they liked, watching it come together in the\naftermath of war. They helped in the rebuilding effort\nhere and there with magic and even the occasional sigh.\nWhen their wanderings were done, they returned to\nGarreg Mach, to which they also lent their restorative\ntalents, both above and below the ground. It is said\nthat they remained lifelong friends, steadfast through\nthick and thin forever after.'
b"For her service in war and her innovations in magic,\nConstance von Nuvelle was among the first to receive\npeerage from Emperor Edelgard. Though her noble\nhouse was given no guarantee of power on a hereditary\nbasis, Constance made certain that House Nuvelle would\nbe relied upon in helping to achieve Edelgard's vision of\na new social order. The emperor kept Constance close\nat hand and routinely recognized her counsel as valuable,\nwhich helped to bolster Constance's own sense of worth.\nIt is rumored that the two were also dear personal friends\nand that they would frequently slip away from duties of\ngovernance to traipse through the capital together."
b"After officially becoming the new Duke Aegir, Ferdinand\nfound that he had a new neighbor in Constance, whose\nrevived noble house was granted the old Hrym territory\nfor its domain. It was a prescient move by Emperor\nEdelgard, as Ferdinand and Constance were quick to\nmarry and merge their adjoining territories. The couple's\ndiverse talents helped them overcome countless obstacles\ntogether, in pursuit of a restored land and a new social\norder for the Empire."

They were married in short order, and\ntheir adjoining territories were merged. The couple's\ndiverse talents helped them overcome countless obstacles\ntogether, in pursuit of a restored land. They had many\nchildren, including one who became well-known in her\nown right for the advancements she brought to her\nmother's research. For generations thereafter, House\nNuvelle stood at the forefront of magical progress."
b"After the war, Constance and Mercedes traveled together\nto the school of sorcery in Fhirdiad. There, they immersed\nthemselves in magical research and, with the help of their\nfriends and all the school's resources, made one astounding\ndiscovery after another. Their considerable achievements\nled to the revitalization of both House Nuvelle and House\nMartritz. The pair grew increasingly close over the years\nso that, as time wore on, they became less like friends and\nmore like family. It is said that, years later, each began to\nspeak of the other as if she were a dear sister."
b"After his coronation, Dimitri assumed the throne of the\nHoly Kingdom of Faerghus. He focused first and foremost\non the restoration of the Kingdom but at the same time\nworked to expose the schemes of Cornelia and of those\nwho conspired to bring about the Tragedy of Duscur.\nAlways by his side was Hapi, who relentlessly pursued\nthose who slither in the dark and, with Dimitri's help,\ndiscovered a magic spell to rid herself of her condition.\nOnce all had settled down, the pair was known to have\ntea together often in the capital. It is said that Dimitri's\ntendency to discuss politics during tea time frequently\nmoved Hapi to smirk, shake her head, and sigh."
b"After the war, Ashe was formally knighted and appointed\nthe new head of House Gaspard, which had no successors.\nHe soon married Hapi, whose competence lent much\nreliability to the governance of their territory. The ruling\ncouple developed a frank and earnest relationship with\ntheir people, and the territory prospered. They were also\nblessed with many children, and their home was always\nso busy and full of merriment that there was never an\noccasion to sigh. It is said that Hapi took such delight in\nrecounting Ashe's stories to their children that it became\nhard to believe she had ever despised knights."
b"After the war, Linhardt abandoned his inherited position\nand instead journeyed with Hapi to the village both she\nand Saint Timotheos were from. The villagers initially\nbristled at the arrival but welcomed the two once they\nrecognized Hapi. Combining what he had uncovered\nbeneath Garreg Mach with notes found in the village said\nto have been left by Timotheos himself, Linhardt swiftly\nunraveled the mystery of Hapi's unique power. With little\nto do once the research was completed, the pair embarked\nupon a life of leisure together."
b'When Galatea territory was seized, Ingrid argued strongly\nfor the preservation of its borders. Her request was\ngranted, and she was appointed to rule. Though, since she\nhad previously abandoned her noble house, she was not\nwell accepted by the people. Despite this, she found that\nthe commonfolk carried out her policies with unexpected\nenthusiasm and efficiency. She soon discovered that it was\nYuri who had convinced them of her wisdom. The two\nwere reunited and eventually married, and under their\nstewardship, Galatea territory flourished. It is said that,\nafter a busy day of governance, Ingrid yearned for nothing\nmore than a home-cooked meal prepared by her husband.'
b'After the war, Rhea resumed her duties as the archbishop,\nand Seteth and Catherine joined her in rebuilding the\nKnights of Seiros. As ever, Seteth served as her second in\ncommand and Catherine remained one of her most trusted\nprotectors.

Though initially reluctant,\nCatherine is said to have been persuaded to accept by\na nudge from Rhea herself. The two were wed in a packed\nand lively ceremony, and afterward they lived out their\nlives happily as husband and wife.'
