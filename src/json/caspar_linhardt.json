[{"content":"After the war, Linhardt and Caspar abandoned their noble houses to pursue a carefree journey wandering the world. They traveled to every corner of Fodlan, and even ventured abroad now and again. Caspar got into trouble at every turn on their travels, but Linhardt was always there, begrudgingly, to get him out of it. The records of their adventures were immortalized in a book by an anonymous author, entitled \"The Thousand Roads and Seven Seas.\" It is said they did eventually settle down, after the events in those stories, but where they actually went is unknown.","routes":[[0,0,0],[1,0,0],[2,0,0],[3,0,0]]}]
