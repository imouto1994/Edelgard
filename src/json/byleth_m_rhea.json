In the aftermath of the loss of Fódlan's great leading figures, he ascended the throne as the first leader of the United Kingdom of Fódlan.

From his temporary residence at Garreg Mach Monastery, he endeavored to restore and develop Fódlan. Having narrowly escaped death, Rhea took time to recover her strength before returning to her role as archbishop. Upon her return, she applied herself to rehabilitating the church and helping those who had suffered because of the war.
