[{"content":"After the war, Constance devoted herself to her magical research. Her unorthodox methods allowed her to make great strides, which earned her acclaim and eventually enabled her to restore her noble house. Afterward, almost as if to spite her detractors, she married Yuri. The pair made a happy, if unconventional, couple, as the husband frequently ventured away for months on end.

Many decades later, he passed away in bed alongside his beloved wife.","routes":[[0,0,0],[1,0,0],[2,0,0],[3,0,0]]}]
