[{"content":"Entrusting the future of Fodlan to his friends, Claude left for Almyra to reclaim his place as heir to the throne. Several years later, when he became king, he took initial steps to open diplomatic relations with Fodlan, and asked Garreg Mach for aid. Alongside him was his wife, Flayn, who had gone missing during the war, but who now worked tirelessly to bridge the gap between their two lands for the sake of the late Seteth. It is said that some churchgoers disapproved of this new stance toward Almyra at first, but that Flayn's love for Claude proved to be a key inspiration in shifting the perspectives of the populace.","routes":[[2,0,0]]}]
