[{"content":"Petra returned to her homeland of Brigid, and inherited the throne from her grandfather. As ruler, she declared independence from Fódlan, and renegotiated Brigid's diplomatic ties on more equal terms. Some years later, the Church of Seiros expanded its reach to Nuvelle, a town in western Fódlan. The priest sent to this new church, for the purpose of keeping up relations with Brigid, was none other than Cyril.

It is said that their union served as a symbol for the friendly ties between the two countries for the whole of their lives.","routes":[[1,0,1],[2,0,1],[3,0,1]]}]
