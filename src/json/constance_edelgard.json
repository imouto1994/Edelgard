[{"content":"For her service in war and her innovations in magic, Constance von Nuvelle was among the first to receive peerage from Emperor Edelgard. Though her noble house was given no guarantee of power on a hereditary basis, Constance made certain that House Nuvelle would be relied upon in helping to achieve Edelgard's vision of a new social order. The emperor kept Constance close at hand and routinely recognized her counsel as valuable, which helped to bolster Constance's own sense of worth. It is rumored that the two were also dear personal friends and that they would frequently slip away from duties of governance to traipse through the capital together.","routes":[[0,1,0]]}]
