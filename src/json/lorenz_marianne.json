[{"content":"As the new head of House Gloucester, Lorenz first worked to restore his own territory, and then expanded his vision to include reforms for all FÃ³dlan. At the height of his storied political career, he announced his marriage to Marianne. Prior to the wedding, she received extensive tutelage from her adoptive father, Margrave Edmund, so that by the time they were wed she was fully prepared to govern.

It is said that Lorenz was rather vexed by the title.","routes":[[0,0,0],[1,0,0],[2,0,0],[3,0,0]]}]
