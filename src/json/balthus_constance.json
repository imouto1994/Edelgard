The devastation they wrought in Shambhala was immortalized in a tapestry, entitled \"Avatars of War,\" which preserved their legacy for generations. Afterward, the two were married. Constance was among the first to receive peerage from Emperor Edelgard, and though Balthus sometimes chafed from being at the mercy of his wife's whims, the couple worked diligently to solidify the new social order under Imperial rule.
