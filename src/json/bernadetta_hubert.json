[{"content":"The marriage between Hubert, Minister of the Imperial Household, and Bernadetta, leader of House Varley, was so surprising to the public that it was much talked about even outside of political circles in the capital. Bernadetta took the opportunity to survey the far reaches of the new Adrestian Empire, and in her absence, Hubert took well to the management of Varley territory. They proved to be an astonishingly good match, working together to protect FÃ³dlan from the shadows. It is said that they showed their affection for one another by wearing matching embroidered flowers.","routes":[[0,0,0]]}]
