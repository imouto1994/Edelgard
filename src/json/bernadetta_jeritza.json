[{"content":"After the war for Fodlan, Jeritza threw himself fully into the struggle against those who slither in the dark. Visage masked by the likeness of death itself, he laid waste to his enemies with a scythe that terrified friend and foe alike. When it was all over, he stole away in secret and vanished. At the same time, a mysterious guest arrived in Varley territory, which Bernadetta had inherited from her father.

A rendition of that scene, said to be painted by Bernadetta herself, remains at the estate to this day.","routes":[[0,0,0]]}]
