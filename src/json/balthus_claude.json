[{"content":"Perhaps unexpectedly, Balthus accompanied Claude upon his return to his homeland of Almyra. While Claude assumed the role of a politically active prince, Balthus spent his days drinking, flirting, and brawling. As soon as Claude inherited the throne, however, all that changed. In the blink of an eye, Balthus became son-in-law to the great commander, Nader, and took up a position of military command in service to Claude's stated goal to improve relations with Fodlan. To foster trust, Claude frequently sent Balthus into Fodlan on missions to help quell revolts begun by Imperial loyalists.","routes":[[2,0,0]]}]
