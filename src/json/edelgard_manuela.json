[{"content":"As the new Adrestian emperor, Edelgard gave all she had to breathe new life into the government of FÃ³dlan. Her first objective was to institute new class reforms and ensure the people's independence. For that reason, she sought the counsel of Manuela, whose vast array of contacts, talents, and experience proved invaluable. She became essential to Edelgard, and her skill as a physician kept the emperor in good health for many years. Both remained unmarried, and it is said that the two became extremely close over the years.","routes":[0]}]
