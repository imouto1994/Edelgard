[{"content":"Raphael returned to his hometown to serve his liege lord as a knight, and spent his spare time helping out at the inn that his family had opened during his time away. Due to his grandfather's age, he was compelled before long to give up knighthood and manage the inn full-time. Soon after that, the inn began to be frequented by Lysithea and her family, who had renounced all claim to nobility and begun a life as commoners. Lysithea found a kindred spirit in Raphael's sister, Maya, and before long, found herself helping out around the place too. Eventually she was put in charge of the kitchen, where it is said she spent the rest of her days happily working.","routes":[[0,0,0],[1,0,0],[2,0,0],[3,0,0]]}]
