[{"content":"Soon after the war, Flayn disappeared. Ignatz searched unsuccessfully for her for a time, but finally gave up and went home. With hard-won permission from his family, he then set out to travel the world as an artist. Years later, his journey took him by chance to Garreg Mach, where the statue of Saint Cethleann inspired him to paint. It was then that Flayn finally appeared, wondering aloud why Ignatz was not painting her as he'd promised. Overjoyed, Ignatz devoted much of the rest of his artistic career to getting Flayn's likeness just right. Her visage was finally captured in the work he called The Second Advent of a Saint, which was widely regarded as a masterpiece.","routes":[[1,0,0],[2,0,0],[3,0,0]]}]
