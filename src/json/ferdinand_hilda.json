[{"content":"After becoming the new Duke Aegir, Ferdinand married Hilda, the daughter of Duke Goneril. The marriage was warmly received by the people, with high expectations placed on them as they set about restoring the territory. Hilda rarely took part in politics herself, but she still contributed greatly by recommending exceptional people to influential positions. Her hobby of creating fashionable accessories also bore fruit, as her designs achieved widespread popularity, and she created the first artisan academy in FÃ³dlan. The school produced many talented craftsmen, including Ferdinand himself, who was said to craft handmade trinkets for his wife.","routes":[1,2,3]}]
